App17,io.github.benoitduffez.cupsprint,Not really working for me. I have setup my raspberry pi as print server with cups and it works on my Windows PC via samba _  but when using this app _  though the printer is discovered _  the file goes into infinite spooling. The printer I'm using is the Epson AL M2300 Edit: Yes _  everything should work correctly. If it works through Samba I don't see why it shouldn't work on Android _  unless I have to setup different drivers and I don't know that...,3,05/31/2020,1
App17,io.github.benoitduffez.cupsprint,Really good developer support but it is still not working. I have supplied the CUPS server ip address but it still hasn't found any printers. The number of times I need to print from my phone is so small it'll be easier for me to email whatever I want to print to myself and print from a device where ipp and CUPS works. Clearly this app works for lots of people but from my point of view it is still 1 star.,1,04/08/2020,0
App17,io.github.benoitduffez.cupsprint,It took a lot of work to configure my Ubuntu server to have CUPS listen on the local subnet. I had to create a self signed certificate because Android will only print to secure printers. I also enabled cups-browsed. After these things _  I could immediately print from my Note 9! No configuration was required on the phone itself. Wonderful app _  thank you.,5,12/08/2019,7
App17,io.github.benoitduffez.cupsprint,added printer. no verification of success fail. no debug indication. see printer in list cant click on it. is that a button? thanks _  otherwiso great app,2,04/02/2020,1

App17,io.github.benoitduffez.cupsprint,By far the best CUPS printing app from Android. Anyone reading this _  if you have a CUPS project use this app _  don't fall for the other rubboshly made apps. This developer is outstanding _  been looking for this a long time. Thank you very much for your solo effort _  you have made this beautiful app that is simply the best printing client! Kudos to you.,5,12/14/2018,21
App17,io.github.benoitduffez.cupsprint,PDF print to "(Android) CUPS Printing (this app on phone)" -> WiFi -> Linux CUPS server -> HP JetDirect EX Plus3 (LPT port 1 of 3) -> HP LaserJet 6MP  Adobe PDF Reader printed to "HP LaserJet 6MP@[hostname]" looks exactly as the PDF displays on the screen.  <p>  CUPS Server Notes (Ubuntu 18.08.1): [x] "Publish shared printers connected to this system" (my JetDirect is connected to this server) for your local subnet.

App17,io.github.benoitduffez.cupsprint,It does work fine with Fedora Linux CUPS server for me. Although I had to add the printer by its explicit URL _  not even specifying CUPS server IP address helped. Although after adding the URL it then added the manually enter printer and also about 10 times the same printer with full description so it apparently found the printer then even somehow automatically. Still it works better than other Android app "Let's Print Droid" by BlackSpruce.,4,01/04/2019,1

No more having to use the proprietary printer applications for wireless printing :)  I _  however _  encountered problems printing PDFs as the font would get substituted at the printer level. I fixed this by changing my PDFs to have embedded fonts and it's not an issue any more for newly created PDFs.,4,06/25/2017,23
App17,io.github.benoitduffez.cupsprint,This is the best and the simplest printing app I have ever seen _  direct  ---- printing from any Android app _  just like the Android print service which  ---- was unable to discover my CUPS printer hosted on a Raspberry Pi 3. I had  ---- tried several apps such as PrinterShare _  StarPrint before but they were  ---- sooo clumsy and slow..... This is a must-have app for CUPS printers.

App17,io.github.benoitduffez.cupsprint,Great printing service! It's the only one I could find to work at NDSU. The only issues I found is that the documents appear at the printing stations under "anonymous" and sometimes the file name (ex. "Ftables.pdf") don't appear.,4,01/17/2018,7
