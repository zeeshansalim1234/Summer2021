App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,3 stars only I'm waiting for more than 3 months for an update and still no luck because I struggle to watch one movie and no luck 2007 the drummer. Please i really need to watch that movie. Can you update and make that movie available plz.,3,05/29/2020,11
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Adding to the folks w/ Pixel 4XLs... Open the app _  grant permissions _  and a blank black scrren appears. Doesn't appear to have any method to access any settings or menus. Will investigate activities to see if I can force something to work _  and will post update. Still nothing. Sadly uninstalling.,1,05/30/2020,3
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,For music it completely sucks. You can create playlists but don't add the wrong song or forget a song as you will not be able to edit _  even though there is an edit option. It's hard to find and get to the playlist once you exit the add. Once you find the playlist again it's impossible getting it open as everything you tap on it the page goes to something else and if you click on anything on that screen it won't load.,2,05/16/2020,39
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Definitely recommend this app _  but you have to know what you are doing _  if you think by downloading it that the content is on the app than you haven't done the proper research. Any negative reviews make sure to watch SOLOMON KODI channel hes very thorough with his instructions on how and where to find the necessary tools and links to get you on your way.,5,05/02/2020,217
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I love my Kodi! Works like a charm! Don't know how I ever lived without it... lol. It takes a minute to get it all figured out and put together _  but it's well worth the time and effort that's put into building it. I'll never be without it again. I highly recommend this app. Thank you to all the devs who make it possible!,3,05/19/2020,9
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,After TV update to Android 8.0 version or Kodi update to 18.6 version it became impossible to watch some videos. Sound is unsynchronized and none settings help to solve the problem. It is great app. I used it on my TV for 2 years and didn't have any problems earlier. Its so sad that there is no solution for the sound syncing problem. Manual changing of offset is not a reasonable solution.,3,03/29/2020,147
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,love this app and thre 3rd party wizard applications its an amazingly awesome app that gives you access to a vast amount of very expensive material for free or very low cost. DO NOT LISTEN to posts that reflect badly on KODI for the fact that it is a bogus app and doesnt work. IT works beautifuly you just have to know how to work iot and it takes some practice,5,05/10/2020,19

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Good enough for playing songs from my Windows PC over SMB. The GUI is not intuitive. Takes time to understand. The music player can suddenly stop in the middle of a song for some seconds a jump to next one.,4,05/06/2020,10
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Running kodi 18.5 on a galaxy S5. Im running kodi 18.0 on fire stick. All working well. Kodi on galaxy S9 running android 10 _  I give 2 stars. Looks like google is going after kodi. Since the android update a lot of live channels crashes kodi. Wont be long before firestick gets an update and the same problems will happen. UPDATE: 18.6 is extremely slow _  click _  wait 50 seconds _  click _  wait 40 seconds _  click  _  wait 45 seconds. forgot what i clicked on _  F that _  back to 18.0,2,04/28/2020,152
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Just when you get it running OK _  they release a new version! The Windows version I couldnt to run stably even with latest release on Win10 Home. I tried loading builds manually _  then tried Configurator for Kodi to load some builds but gave up. I'm now running Bluestacks on Win10 with Android version of Kodi and Configurator and everything works great. That is until after several reboots the No Limits Magic build skin I'm running disapears  _  but the apps are all still there under My Addons.,4,03/15/2020,93
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Installed on Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra and after accepting file access permission just goes to a black screen. Cannot change with reinstall or clearing cache etc. Needs fix Update. After doing my own research the issue is with ANY display refresh settings over 60hz so make sure you lower your refresh to install this and it works.,3,05/03/2020,19
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,As others already mentioned the app goes to black screen on 90hz or higher refresh rates and kodi team developers "demand" other people to fix their app if they want "higher refresh rates than 60" because it's open source. Welp there are lots of other "open source" apps that are not stuck in the last decade,1,05/06/2020,7
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Doesn't work on Pixel 4. Black screen as soon as I open the app. Tried "Force Stop" _  clearing cache _  and clear data (since the app hasn't been used)... nothing.,1,05/27/2020,2
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,My BF found this app recently. It has quiet a few new movies on it. Some l don't think have been in theater's yet. It's crazy. Its really neat _  because we don't have the app on our RoKu. Only on our phones. Which is nice for personal use _  but not for a movie night lol. My BF's phone can cast Whatever is on his phone screen to our TV via Blutooth. It can be a pic _  movie _  ANYTHlNG that shows up on his screen will show on the TV.....I'm Jelous lol.,4,05/01/2020,35

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Not sure why others are having issue _  I upgraded my old version 18.5 to 18.6 I notice faster and stability on my end. Just be sure anyone reading this _  you have a fast reliable internet connection. Please consider adding different designs or skins for us to choose from.,5,04/02/2020,42

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Very useful app to do many different stuff _  however you have to really know what your doing or you will just have a blank app. MY opinion on it was much higher,4,05/29/2020,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Brilaint April fools lol! Actually thought kodi was limiting bandwidth. Priceless app and always has been. I've viewed most of the content in my life through this app. The completely untechincal people that complain about this app and simply cannot understand it should immediately remove it and use an apple TV.... Stop leaving bad reviews about one of the best apps ever invented for mobile and TV...... Zzzzz,5,04/05/2020,29
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Sorry about that google having one bad days when I gave that last review. So honestly in all fairness this app is well worth a five rating.

Great work Team Kodi.,5,03/12/2020,94
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Great app _  surprised to find it on the app store _  though I suppose it's just a media platform at heart until you start to configure and modify it then it get into the grey area of things. Always run a VPN and you'll have no worries!,5,04/03/2020,27
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,It is a bit slow for me but other than that it is fantastic download it if you have fast or medium internet because you can see free movies _ tv shows _ cartoons _ music and more I recommend that you get it now,4,04/18/2020,5

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Big fan of Kodi using it on previous Android phones and TVs _  even on Raspberry Pi. Unfortunately it doesn't work on Pixel 4. Loads with a black screen after initial load and accepting media access. Restarted _  removed _  reinstalled... No difference :(,1,04/25/2020,7
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,The app is usually awesome. But really recently everytime I try to use my remote it says it's a "new recognized" device even though it's not and when I try to configure it/reset the input it doesn't really do anything for it,1,03/28/2020,11
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,AMAZING!!! You developers should be super proud. Using this app on our nvidia shield and it blows every other media app out of the water. Supports all high end audio and video codexs. Thanks so much for this amazing app!!!,5,04/23/2020,4
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Well I finally got it fully up and running. It took the better part of 2 hours to find the right addon that works but at least now I can watch whatever I want on my phone.

Recently I've gone back over M*A*S*H and Rumpole of the Bailey but also brand new content which I can't get from any single source. It isn't easy to master but there are step by step instructions on where and how to get the latest addons which give you access to lots of different sorts of content.

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Bad every add on never works no matter which version _  more trouble than its worth. Will take you countless hours just to get a decent addon then when you finally grt it work they release a new version which is usually a sub par than what it was before.,1,05/01/2020,0

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,So it crashes all the time. Enough to not want to deal with the app at all. I've been researching the reason as to why _  and basically it comes down to Google made some changes with Android 10. But it's not up to Google to change things for an app to work again _  it's the platform and Kodi Android Developers are going to have to figure it out or shut this platform down _  because this is the way forward for Android. Soon enough all Android based phones will be Android 10 or better.,1,03/03/2020,67
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Disaster in the matter of Subtitles in most of the none English languages. No support to UTF 8 and others format subtitles. It will display as squares in your screen. I moved to plex and Jellyfin only because of lack of support in subtitles. As a media center Kodi is really good. But there are a lot of people as none English speakers. If Plex Jellyfin and VLC MX player can process other language subtitles (UTF 8 _  UTF16) then why Kodi can't? Will be back to Kodi once Kodi support UTF8.,3,01/13/2020,0

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Kodi is a powerhouse media app that supports RESOLUTION & REFRESH RATE SWITCHING even on Android! My entire house uses kodi as a frontend for media stored across servers _  nas _  and local. I use plexkodiconnect _  SMB _  HTTPS _  & FTP for backend. It took some time to set everything up but it's been flawless since. I use Kodi on Windows 10 HTPC's and Nvidia Shield _  and even my Note 10+. I dont stream illegal content or use shady addons. These are threatening the future for kodi and it needs to end now.,5,02/08/2020,98
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I get this not a paid service. Kodi worked ok when first started using now basically the question I ask is what good is a free app that doesn't work.

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Kodi works great! I have the add on Exodus Redux which also comes with Adult Swim (cartoons).

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Won't load any online media. Media on my phone loads completely fine. When I connect to online repos and then try loading media then nothing happens.

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Kodi 18.0 was not the "upgrade" I was looking for. The inability to play split archives is a dealbreaker for me.

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Really unintuitive. Could not even work out how to get it to scan the content on my phone and cast a show to my TV. Every other solution I've come across makes that easy.

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Simple _  this app was made to be customized. That unfortunately comes at the cost of usability _  but with enough efforts _  anything is possible. Just... don't use it to pirate stuff. That type of use is not supported by the developpers _  because it's illigal. Plus _  you need to have third party application to do that _  so if you complain that it is too complicated _  you are probably trying to install a third party addon. The only real problem is the keyboard. Overall _  great _  powerfull app.,4,05/14/2019,12

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Useless on android. The average rating of recent reviews confirms the experience I had: Very poor OS-support. Must have been a good app once upon a time when overall rating still is 4.2.,1,12/30/2019,5
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,love it when it works. sometimes the add-ons disappear and i have to redownload a build. it's not too complicated because i have a kodi configurator but it can be frustrating. it also takes a LOT of room to install the app and the build that makes it work. otherwise _  great app. i tell all my friends about it. if these few small issues could somehow be remedied _  I'd give 5 stars in a heartbeat but they are not serious enough to make the app an uninstall.,4,06/15/2019,4
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Please be advised that the new version had a problem with video to audio sync. It needs fixing before anyone should use it.,2,01/05/2020,3
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Been using since release 16. I don't think I've ever had a problem with Kodi. Problems with add-ons _  problems with builds _  but never a problem with Kodi,5,01/05/2020,8
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I now like the app. it took me a month to learn the program. i am using it in a community channel. thank you,5,03/06/2020,1

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,It's a good app but Freeze's a lot _  if wasn't for that it would be 5 stars. But very good app don't get me wrong because it might just be my phone lol.,4,02/21/2020,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Extremely difficult to set up and the scrapers are garbage. Even using the nfo file method yielded no results. Stupid Archos player is better at scraping and letting me pick the right title. Gives me a list of 112 wrong matches and never includes the right one to choose. Tried another scraper add-in and got worse results. Infinitely infuriating especially when I'm just trying to set it up for my kids to use on their tablets. Waste of my time.,1,09/19/2018,2
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,User interface is rough. - In poster view _  most of the screen area doesn't respond to scrolling. - You can accidentally start media playback by tapping "options" if there is a thumbnail "behind" the button. - When the options panel is open _  tapping outside it doesn't just close the panel _  but starts whatever media your finger landed on. - In InfoWall mode _  there is an annoying animation after each scroll gesture that briefly prevents further scrolling. - Review length limit reached :( Google...,3,03/11/2019,4
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Miserable experience. I just want to replicate my library from my pc to my phone. I can stream the content just fine _  but I can't set my movies folder so that tapping on movies on the home menu brings me to my movies instead of the file explorer. Can't find any help online. Had absolutely no issues on PC _  doing everything the same here but it just won't work.,1,01/15/2019,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,When using this version on my NVIDIA Shield TV Kodi would stop regularly during playback _  which was getting rather annoying. I just wanted to come on here to say that I found a solution to this on the Kodi forums and it has something to do with the version of 18.1 on the Google Play Store. I downloaded and side-loaded 18.1 off the Kodi website _  turned off auto-updating for my apps and haven't had a problem since.,1,03/10/2019,4
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I have been using Kodi before it was called Kodi (XBMC) on origional xbox. When the team went cross platform I was at a loss but it really was the best thing for it. Great software and will swear by it.,5,12/10/2019,85
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Kodi simply sucks! Don't waste your time unless you like buffering. This is all kodi does is buffer. If I can watch YouTube without buffering _  and not this garbage app. Do not down load kodi. A big waste of time and phone space.,1,02/29/2020,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,ive been using kodi for years and it is a lifesaver! you can stream anything you can imagine with the right respository. there are alot of negative reviews which is understandable but i dont think many people know how it works. 3rd party respositories change or stop working constantly _  that is not the fault of the kodi app. i have personally had no issues with the new update and kodi overall has come a long way since i first started using it. i mean...its free! so be patient _  kind and grateful!!,5,03/14/2019,498
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Used to love it. Now it crashes whenever I try to play a video on an addon. Make it work and il change it from 1 star to 5 stars,1,12/23/2019,7

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Aside from erasing and then making it nearly impossible to remap to an existing home media server _  it's also completely useless after the latest update. It's cumbersome UI no longer supports the best skins and themes available _  it does not seem to be able to download and support any required dependencies in order to properly function. Every attempt gives a "not compatible with this version" error. Developer's completely blew it on this one.,1,01/29/2019,31
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I wish it was easier to update the movie players better. It plays it good for a certain amounts of time _  then it gets hard to play the movies. Just wish that there was an easier tutorial to updating it and maintaining the applications. Besides those problems _  its an awesome app to have when on a low budget _  when it comes to watching movies and/or tv shows.,4,08/30/2019,71
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I'm reviewing the PC along with this app. It's a pain to use. files aren't recognized even fixing dozen of times _  there's no help but some handful of old forum stuffs years ago _  whose suggestions doesn't work. Especially series _  it makes no sense _  just add the video as is _  stop nitpicking titles _  thats just so dumb.,1,06/29/2019,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Horrid! Don't leave 17.6! Wish that I never downloaded this. It just stops and goes back to the streams and or just freezes _  it is horrible!!! I want to know how to go back to 17.6? Why would you put out something as unstable as this is? Kodi is wonderful _  fantastic....but this is the bottom of the barrel. Please fix or provide the link to get 17.6 back!,1,09/02/2019,11

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I used to love this app and then the update came for ver 18 now i can't get it to work. All my builds don't work properly on my Android. For example _  I installed sreamline build and it wouldn't do anything when i pressed the buttons. Same thing with leia build _  woman build _  best 18 build are all not working. Ive tried 2 diff phones. Also _  add-ons don't update. Please fix ASAP or tell me how i can fix it my dang self!! 😠😤,2,04/08/2019,180
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Interface to browse medias is very nice _  but make an effort to improve your video player. On the Formuler TV (hisilicon) the video player is not able to path through DTS. DTS is an old codec and an old WD live tv was easily able to play it. mrmc is able to play it and seems to be a fork of KODI. With the Leia version on the same device (Formuler Z7+) video playback is sluttering sometimes and if you pause the playback and replay it _  audio made gaps...,2,03/16/2019,18
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I absolutely love this app and have for a few years. Exodus is really good to use on it. The only thing that makes me really mad is that sometimes the quality and sound will get really bad so i uninstall it and restart my phone. Then when i go and try to put a new install for exodus it say new version 0.0 and wont install.,4,12/06/2018,2
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Works great on Windows 10 an previous version of Windows. Have been using Kodi way back from the beginning. It seems most of the negative reviews are from people trying to watch on a cell phone _  seriously. And alot of them are from people who just don't understand how Kodi works. Yes you have the lastest version 18 _  but there are many different builds _  some work better than others. And if you don't know what a build is go to YouTube and watch learn. Don't condem Kodi condem yourself LOL,5,10/18/2019,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I installed this app on my Shield TV and can't get it to connect to my PC where all my media is stored. I spent hours and hours trying _  reading Kodi Wiki and discussion forums and no success. Reading the forums shows that lots of people have this problem. So this is only for networking experts. Plex is soooo easy to connect - in a few clicks _  and it works all the time. I don't like Plex for sharing pictures _  so I wanted to try Kodi. This is my third try with Kodi after several years. They still haven't figured out how to make it easy for ordinary people.,1,05/08/2019,75
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,18.5 is a lot more buggy than 18.4 _  constantly freezing up or closing. i'd wait to upgrade until a more stable version is released...,3,01/05/2020,5
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Looks like Leia is a no-go. All the add-ons I installed for Krypton 17.6 don't work like Exodus _  CCloud _  and many others. Luckily that was a test setup. I had the 17.6 apk backed up and you can't install the older version over 18.0 Leia so you'll have to redo all your add-ons. Wait a few weeks or months until this is stable like Krypton. More importantly _  always have a test build to work with when new software gets released to avoid heartache and work...,1,01/30/2019,34
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Just switched to Pixel 4XL and the app just goes black after granting permissions. Refuses to change screens from the black one. I have the latest Android and have tried lower versions but nothing works. Seriously annoyed but welcome any help!,1,12/15/2019,42
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I have been very happy with 17.6 which was doing fine playing 4K movies on SHIELD. But 18 has totally messed this up _  have to put in a whitelist 4k resolution as only 1080p resolution can be set up _  and still there are colouring issues.  Well I have to switched to VLC instead.  A total clean install with 18.2 seems to have fixed the issue. Now happy again _  but do not allow automatic update anymore.,4,06/07/2019,37
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,v18.0 clearly has major issues. I had to uninstall two devices and sideload back to revert to v17.6. Then an auto update that introduces known incompatibility such as skins should never happen. However _  it's free _  no adverts _  a truly great app etc. I have no connection with Kodi _  but really dislike reviews that show "hate" and an agressive attitude at the developer community - who do not have to create this platform. Get a perspective. Roll back to 17.6 _  and give them a chance.,1,02/04/2019,22
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,For the last week or two the app won't let me open it 90% of the time... I've done everything but try to uninstall the app so I hope that works.... It took forever to learn the app and it has worked great for the last year or two so I'd hate to stop using it so please fix the latest update or you may use a valued customer because I love telling people about your app... Thank you _ Steve,5,09/26/2019,22
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I've been delaying the update to Leia due to bad reviews but now _  after using it for a few days i have to wonder why i did that. Every addon i used back in older versions works well _  no crashes _  it's not slow and it most certainly didn't fried my cat but those hatefull _  brainless comments here almost did. From my experience _  just a bit of googling solves any problem _  yet again _  leaving a bad review is easier. Maggots...,5,03/14/2019,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Kodi playback was flawless on all of my devices at 17.6. Forced play store upgrade to 18.1 has made video playback stutter _  caused by problems in the HW acceleration on all android devices I've tried it on. WAF is in the negatives at the moment.  Devices include an x96 box _  2017 model Sony Android TV _  M8S II. Issue is present on all.  Will be rolling back to 17.6 via APK until problem is resolved.,2,03/19/2019,35
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Moved to using Kodi 17.6 on Andoid TV _  and it was relatively stable.  Upgraded (huge mistake) to 18 _  as there is no downgrade on the store _  and it hangs playing _  is just unusable..  I'd think there would have been testing of this release level on Android TV as it is quite a bit different than the standalone version _  and impossible to move back to other releases for users.  We aren't alpha and beta testers _  this should at least work as well as the prior version.  Very sad this has to be posted _  as the standalone version is mostly good experience.    I've not loaded a .0 release before _  should have known better.,1,02/02/2019,17
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,New updates have destroyed the app. Library is not updated. Shows cannot be found. Carry out a full scan only to be completely reset on next bootup. A brilliant _  brilliant app when it works but new updates are clearly flawed. I've gone back to 17.6 & deactivated auto update. Please fix!,1,03/18/2019,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Since the Leila update _  none of my devices work properly or smoothly(S7 active _  Galaxy Tab A _  Fire TV box 2 _  Firestick 4K and have installed appropriate cpu versions for each). Seeing how others are experiencing similar issues _  I would suggest to everyone to revert to 17.6 _  I loved this software until this past version update. I know myself and others would love to see a permanent upnp source option too.,2,03/19/2019,18
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,New update is beyond horrible!!!! Can't get any builds to work.. I have uninstalled the app and have no plans on reinstalling unless kodi fixes this update or goes back to the older version or a newer one like the older ones. KODI READ AND LISTEN TO THE REVIEWS _  NO ONE IS HAPPY WITH IT!! DO SOMETHING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!😠😠😠😠 Deserves no stars but won't let me post unless i give at least one so thats allbim giving!!,1,03/05/2019,9
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,This update makes the kodi app completely unresponsive on its opening homepage. then _  after autoscan of library _  the screen goes blank and i have to unplug and plug back in the NVIDIA shield. Kodi 17 worked absolutely perfect besodes the lack of support for Android channels integration. I will be forced to downgrade and sideload 17 if this isn't fixed. Hardware: NVIDIA shield TV (2017-non pro edition _  16GB ROM _  movies stored on separate TTOS Linux NAS _  no additional plug-ins installed),1,02/10/2019,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Kodi is by far the best media management app if you have powerful viewing devices but a weak storage system. Plex would be better if it had file streaming without transcoding but it doesn't. For anyone with some semblance of a server at home like a NAS or a video game streaming system that's on 24/7. I'd recommend giving Kodi with MySQL server a try.,5,02/23/2019,105
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,0 out of 5 stars. It was awful. The moment i got on it the app made a horrendous hissing noise out of nowhere that sounded like static from a tv. It was honestly so shocking and deafning that i threw my phone across my bed in fright and my heart was racing. Worst experience ive ever had on an app that scared me half to death. On top of that _  there was nothing on the app just a blank grey screen. I dunno whats wrong but whatever it is _  SORT IT OUT NOW! You cant get away with this!,1,12/02/2019,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,TerrariumTV was miles & away better than Kodi _  but unfortunately was shut down by the developer. Kodi is very average _  works okay on PC & phone...but _  almost useless on Amazon fireTV or Android TV's. Loads very slowly and crashes a lot. Don't believe when you're told that you have a bad internet connection _  something wrong with your TV (or external Android device) _  the build/add-ons that you've installed on it _  or that you're not issuing it for it's intended use. TerrariumTV _  side-by-side _  was quick _  efficient _  and crash-free. Umpteen updates still haven't fixed the problems with Kodi. It's a shame _  bc of it worked the way it should _  it would be awesome...but _  then again _  they'll tell you until they're blue in the face that it's not for illegal streaming (when they know full well it is) it's just an innocent platform. Sure _  whatever. Do yourselves a favor and find another "innocent platform". Cheers _  all!,3,09/14/2018,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Kodi sucks. I can never get it to stream good on my phone or tv with firestick. Plus I hear people say that you can stream anything for free. I've tried some of what are supposed to be the best apps according to everyone and more than half of what I look for is listed but says no stream available. It's a joke and not worth the hassle.,1,09/18/2018,3
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Yikes _  black screen every time I open up the app. Razer Phone 2. Here we are several months later without a solution for the black screen. No bueno tortuga.,1,01/18/2020,4
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I am using kodi 17.6 on a galaxy tab a tablet. I can use this app a few times fine _  but after that the app doesn't open anymore. I have kodi on my television and it works great on it _  but not here. I can redownload the app _  but that gets annoying after a while. Can the operators of the app please fix it and I will change my rating. Thanks,1,01/19/2019,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Do not download from Google Play! This app store doesn't tell you whether you are downloading the arm v7 version of Kodi or the arm v8. You will need to download the correct version based on what processor your device is running. Downloading the wrong version can cause instability within the app as well as database problems _  which make sources inaccessible and stop you from connecting to repositories. Consult the Kodi wiki first then download the correct version from the Kodi TV website.,1,02/11/2019,20
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I am old school and have been using Kodi since it was called XBMC. All the complainers out there should stop and realize that Kodi is open source and free for anyone to use. I am 65 years old and I have no problem using it so if people have a problem with it they can always use Emby or Plex no one has passed a law saying that they have to use Kody. In closing I just want to say that I appreciate and respect the hard work so many have put in to make Kodi the best media centre there is.,5,10/21/2019,72

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Well KODI has finally killed KODI with v18.   Even apps from the KODI repository only play for 5-15 seconds then freeze for 30 seconds or forever.  KODI has always been the McDonalds of coding _  Fast but highly flawed. Glad they don't work for any company which makes mission critical code.  I am also glad I could keep 17.6 on my RPi until I find something better but v18 screwed up my NVIDIA shield to the point of being unusable.,1,02/03/2019,19
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,streaming sites way better than this.

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Such a great application _  but they keep removing core functionality _  and the performance just gets worse. Can't even get ssh to work anymore _  had this running on all my media devices in the house _  one auto update _  and suddenly my kids can't access their media _  and I need to go through the massive task to reconfigure every device in my house. I think the kodi dev team got replaced by a bunch of inexperienced teens. 0 consistency _  0 reliability _  0 performance _  wish I could revert to XBMC,1,02/02/2019,83
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Ugg _  UI is soo bad. Buttons are too small _  no way to go back since it forces immersive mode (have to swipe down to get nav bar _  THEN I have a back button.). Also forces landscape _  even when navigating/configuring. Really a bad UI experience. So bad I gave up trying to test a local music folder.,1,04/22/2019,2
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,New 2019 Android system update causing glitches in Kodi and other entertainment apps involving video video playback and internet downloading can you help? video plays for 3 seconds stops refuses to buffer or cache you have to manually press pause then playto get it to play and it Plays 3 seconds and freezes again. I found this to be so across-the-board and not only with Kodi but other Google apps Yahoo Google Play it did happen right after downloading the update from Android.,2,01/24/2019,2
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Great app for me _  I use it to stream old tv shows that I own but they are all stuck on VHS and my old VCR crapped out years ago. Unfortunately the add-on I use is technically borderline piracy but I collected every season afterschool on my VCR when I was a kid and it was played on tv and took me 5 years and 57 tapes to do so,5,10/28/2018,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Kodi _  used properly _  is the best piece of software I've ever used. I remember when it was called xbmc I believe . Even then it was fantastic and had the ability to play anything you could throw at it. Whether you use legal or illegal addons kodi doesn't differentiate between the two so it's up to the user to decide. There are hundreds if not more apps so one can enjoy what kodi has to offer without causing negative situations. Thank you xbox(not microsoft) ppl for creating this great app.,5,11/21/2019,107

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Just don't bother _  kodi on Windows is incredible but unless your actually natively hosting your content on your android device this app will drive you mental. If like me and the millions of others your trying to watch content on an SMB share then you are totally out of luck _  windows updates continually break compatability and the interface is slow _  buggy and crashes far too easily. If your using SMB then just download YATSE _  set a static IP on your kodi machine and stream to your device.,1,01/08/2019,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Great app to organize your movies! I enable "look for remote UPnP players" in services settings so i can use my samsung 4k built in video player. Because I've noticed that 1080p movies looks better using my TV's video player than my Mi Box S/Kodi. The problem is...the volume is always set to 100%. It feels like I need to change my underwear everytime! Wish that it can detect my TV's current volume level. Or set it 10% NOT 100%. Also _  I've set my Mi Box S resolution to 4k but Kodi still in 1080p.,3,10/02/2019,58

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,This Android version of Kodi does not work as well as the desktop version. I found it almost impossible to select anything or to navigate the user interface.

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I've been trying to connect Trakit & kodi for several hours now. The Kodi/Trakit addon won't install as there seems to be dependency issues. I tried all the solutions I could fin for android _  but nothing worked. I then noticed that lots of people had the same issue across multiple platforms. I love the idea of kodi & I know developers can't be responsible for every app link but when its multiple apps & multiple platforms _  perhaps something needs a tweak to make the process a bit more reliable.,1,05/29/2019,4
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Glad to see Kodi available as an Android app. It's nearly perfect as a network music controller. What it lacks is a skin with vertical orientation for handheld phone use (I've searched but haven't found one yet). It's awkward and fussy to use in horizontal mode on a phone so I hope this mobile-friendly feature can be added soon.,4,07/10/2019,47

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I’ve been using Kodi for years and can’t understand all the praise. First off it’s complicated _  fussy and requires continual tweaking. I recently discovered Stremio which is cloud based _  much more elegant and unlike Kodi is super simple to use. If you enjoy spending hours searching the web for how to fix this and that then enjoy Kodi which seems to have been developed for nerds. Just look at the interface ... you know you are in trouble. To the Kodi developers ... make it simple and make it work.,1,11/17/2019,30

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,An utterly impossible to use app with an incomprehensible interface that has a mind of its own. The setting up is so complex it is impossible without a guide.

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Thank you Team Kodi. Really _  a wonderful app. I used this before on a Raspberry Pi (I prefer LibreELEC _  but to each their own) _  Windows 10 and Ubuntu (thru the team-kodi Launchpad PPA) _  but the official Kodi on Android is better IMHO than the other Kodi forks on Google Play. Accept no substitutes. Download the OFFICIAL Kodi app. You won't regret it. Using on a cheap RCA tablet (the review for Kore is from my other Google account _  which mentions that)... no problems. At all.,5,12/01/2019,32

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Most frustrating app ever. If you have lots _  meaning endless time to waste _  then this is your app. Sure it's free but there's a reason.

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,All of you with issues- Your issues are user or device centric. Maintain kodi on an updated device and you are good. Using a twelve year old comouter or first gen firestick isnt going to cut it. Limited on budget phones as well. Know your device _  maintain your build _  and use a semi modern phone -android box and computer and you should have no issues. Kodi is the bomb. You dont onow how to configue it than get someone who does.,5,09/03/2019,12

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Works fine apart from TV channel order in user defined groups. Using on Moto G4 with Mythtv backend. No problems EXCEPT if you create a TV channel group and add TV channels - the order seems to be random - PREVIOUSLY the order was the order you added them - perfect when you cannot easily alter backend order & alphabetic is unwanted. This applies to the PC x64 version also so it is a whole build issue not Android version. Kodi devs PLEASE FIX!,4,03/14/2019,20
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Love it but some older shows or movies do not have streams available. For instance the asian drama called from 5 to 9 does not have any streams anywhere so I can watch it. Otherwise I've never had a problem with it.,5,10/28/2018,0

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,18.2 seems to be more reliable than formers by faster ending frozen buggy addons but still heavily handling complicated menus oftenly frozen in many addons and somehow badly minded development.

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Very confusing to setup. Unintuitave and too many places for different settings.

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,No wonder we live in a world of disease and ignorance. So many talented people wasting their time interfereing in other's progressive works. You take what we built _  but cannot stop next efforts...the update killed a great OPEN SOURCE media platform.,1,04/03/2020,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,And it automatically merged my old xbmc configuration! This is the best media player ever _  do some digging online to see exactly how great it can be. EDIT: so... I really wanna use this on my Shield TV again. I'm going to do some investigating _  if it is somehow blocked from installing I'm coming back to give you one star.,5,12/08/2019,4
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Been using this since version 1 on the original XBox. I keep trying Plex and I am always disappointed. Kodi has just way better options and support _  better library and better scrappers. Kodi is still the best.,5,12/17/2019,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,This is an awesome app if you take time to learn how to use it. I've been using Kodi for the past 6 years and love it. Took awhile to completely get used to it but well worth it as an overall media center.,5,12/27/2019,0

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,18.5 seems more robust than .4 in some ways _  haven't had to wipe corrupted app data every other day to get it to start. If you want a client for Mediaportal TV server don't bother _  unless you like waiting 30+ secs for responses to setting recordings _  deleting or even just moving through the UI sometimes. Same happens on my fast PC - Kodi 18 just hates Mediaportal and Windows networks (MP native client 10 to 100+ times more responsive!) Kodi just keeps getting less stable with new major versions,1,02/10/2020,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Latest update killed sound. No sound at all. What a colossal waste of time and disk space. 18.5 killed everything. Remote control no longer works. Can no longer scan for my media shared folders. Why does each verson get worse? Hello Plex.,1,02/17/2020,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Works great _  People complaining of crashes and such are blaming Kodi when more than likely it's the third part apps if ya wanna use 3rd party apps don't be cheap pay for real-debrid $9.14 for 6 months and set up Seren. Your welcome,5,03/06/2020,0

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Been a happy Kodi user since V8 but recently its a nightmare. using andrioid v8.1 on a i7 cpu so x86_64 build of kodi should run. Not a chance won't even start. Found the 32bit version for andriod standard cpu works so been using this. but now it force closes all the time if you do anything involving 2 buttons two quick. then there's the fact that the url resolver is broken so crashes during searches been two months now still no update. I give up. used to give this 5 stars . dissapointing,1,09/27/2019,1

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,App is crashing when I press on it to start it. Don't know why it's doing this _  have tried clearing cashe doesn't help _  using on xiaomi mi 8 global _  running miui global 10.3.1 _  device is totaly stock never flashed roms or unlocked bootloader.,3,08/13/2019,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Unusable since UI update Cannot select anything. Tapping opens nothing _  where the marker is in a list or something random. Add to this _  when succeeding in actually playing files _  streaming from DLNA will 95% result in Kodi not remembering playback position _  freeze when trying to play something _  and/or close the player if you switch to another app or the screen sleeps. The core Kodi is awesome. Unfortunately _  this version is unusable with touch devices. Hopefully some next version works.,1,08/07/2019,5
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,This software still gets one star.  I just installed the latest version and i can't add the video source I've had on my home server for more than ten years.  This software used to be easy to use.  No _  it's not.  =Really disappointing.,1,07/17/2019,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Version 18.3 makes streaming and stored videos stutter. Uninstalled _  reinstalled _  tried all types of setting combinations _  no luck. Android box with 6.0. Runs perfectly on my android 8.1 tablet which has version 18.2,3,07/03/2019,2
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,pretty good but sadly missing feature from version 16 where when you pressed O on the keyboard you could see how much of a stream was cached and a lot of other detail. now when you press O it tells you nothing much,4,07/01/2019,30

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,This app is really great and i love it. The good far outweighs the bad by a lot. I only have two things I can think of that bothers me. 1) On my android box _  it automatically swaps to windowed mode sometimes and everything looks real funky and it can't be switched back. 2) the app doesn't let me use my own keyboard _  I have to use the one in the app. I have big fingers and can't hardly use that one _  plus it doesn't allow copy and paste,5,03/19/2019,47
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,18 works fine on my Nvidia Shield but my old Samsung tablets (Galaxy S's) struggle. Plays ok but locks up when trying to exit program. Need to force closure each time. So for now 17.6 is staying on my phone (S7) and tablets. Hopefully future releases will solve the bugs.,5,03/23/2019,1

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Not everyone knows how's it works _  but we all have our favourite addons & repository's _  for streaming what we want _  when we want.Some folk choose Wizard based custom builds (which are excellent for beginners) and are great if you don't have time or simply find it easier than making your own personal build (which requires coding skills) In my opinion the best media streaming software ever...

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,This is by far the superior media center app for windows &/or Android. Plex has too many limitations and is downright ugly! for those complaining that the update screwed everything up for you _  do a little research and not be an idiot. Its not the developers fault that you dont know what you're doing! Lost upnp? Enable it in the settings its not that dang hard people! lost access to your precious PIRATE channels? Oh _  well _  probably shouldn't be stealing anyway! And on that note great job!!!,5,02/17/2019,1

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Update to 18 was nice and easy. All my settings _  go to addons etc. were kept. Nice & easy to update _  no issues _  everything working like it has before. Pity there's so many negative reviews. Nice job team Kodi 👍🏼 * Note Kodi updates automatically if you've allowed auto updates on your system. This can easily be turned off in settings,5,02/06/2019,95
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,once add ons are added enjoy it as much as you can its temporary. add ons constantly stop working. it's a matter of the person who made the add on to update it constantly. there are apks out there that work better than kodi. though it's still a good media source but you need solid addons that won't buffer as much and updated regularly.,3,01/29/2019,40
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,leia killed my build on my Nivdia Shield. Not only did it revert back to that god awful default skin _  it had other major issues. Managed to get it going but only after uninstalling and reininstalling both kodi and my build. Any modification I'd made to the skin gone. Pvr doesn't work still. On my phone it won't even open after multiple uninstall reinstalls. (Samgsung s8+) I have two other android boxes I haven't even checked yet.,1,02/08/2019,48

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Up to the latest 18 RC there were sizable serious bugs in the backend database with duplicate entries pointing to the same path when a TV series has seasons on multiple sources _  and with album artist tag taking priority over the artist tag which caused the music library to create incomplete and seemingly duplicate albums.,2,01/29/2019,13

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I appreciate what this app offers but the user interface is annoyingly out of order. Almost 99% of the time you touch something and it moves it away and brings up something else. I guess it was designed to be used with a remote control and they just threw it at touchscreen android devices. I wish you implemented a user log in based structure to save the settings for future installations and on other devices.  I appreciate your efforts and wish you the best.,1,01/25/2019,10
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I have been using this app (or the SPMC fork) for years _  and for the person who has a large home library of video/audio files this is the best out there. I use it to manage 12TB of files and it works flawlessly _  can it be improved _  of course _  everything can. DO NOT get this if you want to pirate streams _  that is not what it is for _  so don't give a negative review based on something it is not designed to do _  it is a media PLAYER and file organizer that can play just about any format out there _  but the files need to be local. Yes _  it does have some 3rd party plug-in's but most are unsupported by KODI.,5,09/08/2018,150
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,All those negative reviews are just from noobs who need to be spoon-fed  ---- everything or disgruntled folks who are not happy their pirate streams no  ---- longer work. This is a great app _  but you need to know what it's for and  ---- how to use it. Not too difficult if you have at least half a brain.,5,04/21/2018,540
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Very simple it works well. The only issue is you have to stay up to date  ---- with all the YouTube videos and the developers otherwise they'll be lost in  ---- the shuffle. Don't be lazy please if you follow the right people you'll  ---- keep your box up to date I mean think about it you're not paying much for  ---- it if anything at all. So follow the right people on YouTube and you'll  ---- always be updated on the best add-ons. Simply Amazing,5,05/11/2018,239
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,It's OK but there is room for improvement. One of the annoying factors so far is that when you select an addon and instead of the one selected you will get the one next to it opening. Developers please take note of what is written here because this is the only way you are going to make Kodi 17 better. Listen to the people!! The latest update _  17.6 _  keep freezing!!,3,11/22/2017,627
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,PLEASE DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS IF YOU ARE AN IDIOT _  BECAUSE YOUR NEGATIVE  ---- COMMENTS JUST MAKES YOU SOUND STUPID! Just stick to youtube. It is not  ---- designed to pirate streams _  it is designed to put YOUR media that YOU own  ---- at your fingertips. Oh and another thing how about showing these people a  ---- little gratitude _  they do this for free with the help of donations and you  ---- DOWNLOAD it for free. Don't like it MAKE your own.,5,08/17/2018,137
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I used to love this app but since getting my S8 I try deleting builds _  uninstalling Kodi & reinstalling. As sn as I think I'm getting somewhere it says no add on browser??? Can Any1 help I used to cast it to my tv to watch the films on there _  however if I can't sort it I'm going to uninstall altogether.,1,03/31/2018,366
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,to all users giving Kodi bad reviews. its not kodi its self that needs fixing its the specific addon you are using. These addons are the apps that are scraping for feeds and sources for your shows and movies not Kodi. I too have noticed that since TV Addons was taken down by "The Man" with the money others have taken over the repos. But access the streams is getting worse and developers of these new repos weed to fix their scrapers ASAP.,5,01/10/2018,247
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Love this app.  I've free been using for years _  since it was xbmc.  Sometimes I have issues with add-ons and getting videos to play but most the time it's great!  New or old movies and shows _  I don't think anyone can best kodi.... and... it's free!,5,02/12/2018,428
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Massively inferior way of watching movies. Streaming to begin with is a bad  ---- medium as it depends on your connection which for the most part depends on  ---- the weather. Apps within seem incapable of fast forward. Some not able to  ---- resume from where you leave off. When one app no longer works it's very  ---- difficult to install another. Guides on how are rarely accurate so too  ---- difficult to follow. Kodi itself has no auto update and manual update  ---- causes the apps with in to be deleted. No longer worth it at this point.,3,07/13/2018,273
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Decent app BUT needs to be polished up. I love the functionality and versatility of the app as you can make it do almost anything you desire when it comes to entertainment. Add ons were an excellent idea.  I have a Samsung galaxy S8 and the app does not go full screen on it so I have two black bars on either side of my screen which is not nice to look at. If you could add support for the s8 screen ratio that would be great _  same with watching videos if you could add a stretch option. The on-screen keyboard is tiny and I often tap the wrong letter and have to backspace which is very frustrating. The whole touchscreen tapping and scrolling mechanism is a little too sensitive and clunky but I understand the app is run open source and you rely on a community to do the best it can. Overall this app has great potential it just needs a tidy up.,3,01/27/2018,93
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I don't know what happened to Kodi.  I love this app because I was able to use the app to catch up shows that I missed. Also was able to watch shows that I have not seen for a while. Your app was so good that I uninstall Hulu and Netflix. Now I wish I hadn't since I can't get nothing to play on Kodi. It keeps saying it is streaming and nothing happens. I hope the app will be fixed because I don't want to uninstall and loose this good app.,3,03/26/2018,115
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I am very angry right now. There is a bug that causes kodi to play static  ---- VERY loudly when it is launched whilst my headphones are plugged in. This  ---- is not acceptable. The volume of this static seemed to far exeed the volume  ---- setting I have on my phone (about half). I now have a headache cheers guys.  ---- (Bug occurs 100% repeatably on my samsung galaxy s6 _  if headphones are  ---- plugged in whilst launching kodi I get the loud static _  this only stops  ---- when the headphones are unplugged. And works correctly when they are  ---- plugged back in. It does not occur when launched without headphones.),1,05/17/2018,35
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Would have been 5 stars but lately I am clicking the app and the screen  ---- flashes but it won't open.. when it does it is just the grey start-up  ---- background.. I don't want to have to reinstall everything again though as I  ---- have to mess around setting it all up.. any suggestions?,4,05/17/2018,15
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Was working great now all of a sudden i am trying to watch the last couple of episodes of a few series and it keeps showing the very first episode of the series. Have tried over a few days to watch the one i want but it keeps showing the wrong episode. Very frustrating,3,12/16/2017,162
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,For the people that are having streaming difficulties when using 3rd party add-ons or scrapper _  it isn't a fault with Kodi. It could be a number of reasons _  limited bandwidth _  limited content in the country you're in _  etc. ALWAYS use a VPN. 1: a VPN hides your IP _  for privacy reasons. 2: A VPN lets you stream content from one country that would be banned in your own country. 3: A VPN gives you access to better quality streams. Without a VPN you might on get streams in "hq" _  but using a VPN will get you access to 720 _  1080 _  and 4k content. Hope this helps the people having issues with streaming certain content.,5,09/06/2018,5
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Just started today saying "waiting for external storage..." using on my  ---- Nvidia Shield Android TV. Nothing corrects the issue and it's installed on  ---- internal storage as well _  NOT external! What a joke! I'm sick of  ---- uninstalling Kodi _  reinstalling and setting it up again with my preferred  ---- settings _  or having to factory reset my box. This app is turning into  ---- absolute garbage.,1,06/18/2018,31
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I have 4K box with 4K TV and all 4k enabled channels _  I just needed Kodi on my smartphone to pass my time during my commute. But this software feels cheap _  inferior quality. Interface feels sluggish _  constantly crashing on Oreo device. Developers needs to so much work on it.,2,04/07/2018,117
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Not sure why people complaining. There is nothing wrong with the app. I have been using Kodi for years. First of all _  I have a Samasung S8 plus that is running on Oreo. Still works fine. If there is a problem _  it is the user who does not know how to work Kodi. Make it easier for yourself and install a build or something like NoLimit build.,5,04/15/2018,13
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Have no idea how to search or find any show or movie.. send as though you need to do a bunch of things just to watch it. Waist of my time.. Unless someone can explain what needs to be done,1,04/02/2018,43
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Kodi is an amazing tool _  and it works phenomenally on many devices _  but unfortunately this version is absolutely broken. I use it for browsing media on my home server _  and nothing else. It is impossible to navigate the UI for more than 30 seconds without a crash of some sort. If it worked as well as it does on even the simplest of android/linux boxes/SBCs (which have significantly worse hardware than a flagship Android phone) _  then this would be an easy 5 star.,1,01/21/2018,24
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,There's no way of describing Kodi in a short review. If you know what it is you know there's no media center app more feature rich and versatile than Kodi. Note though that the UI is intended mainly for Android TV devices and may be less convenient on phones.,5,03/15/2018,50
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,App not working on latest android update. Click on app but it will not start up _  just freezes and goea to black screen. Will give 5 stars when working again. Galaxy S8+/Android 7.0,2,01/20/2018,96
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Was hoping to be able to use Kodi and leave Plex. But this is worse than Plex. I can't get it to display media from my server in the library via my home network so all I can give is a low review score. Kodi for PC works great _  so does Plex for PC so can't choose between them that way.,2,03/21/2018,8
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I am not interested in third party apps _  but rather in core Kodi's functionality as a media server for locally stored video _  music and image files. In my opinion _  by far the best interface compared to Plex _  Stremio _  and other popular apps. Kudos to the XBMC team for their great work.,5,12/29/2017,42
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I installed Kodi and all of the youtube addons and similar stuff seems good  ---- until you get to live TV. I tried the first PVR addon i saw and it wouldnt  ---- load. After re-installing the app i picked the Vbox addon. And the app  ---- crashed. Restarted it. Bam app crashed. Redownloaded and retried vbox.  ---- Crashed. Yeah im just about done.,1,06/27/2018,18
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,First and most importantly Kodi is NOT for streaming illegally. While it  ---- CAN do it that is not what the developers intended and will offer no  ---- support for illegal stream issues. Second stop rating Kodi badly for THIRD  ---- PARTY ADD-ONS. Also if you cannot figure out how to use Kodi Google it as  ---- their are many guides. Kodi has a steeper learning curve than most  ---- applications so stop being intellectually lazy. Basically stop trashing an  ---- app for things that are not the apps fault! Third-party addons and the  ---- level of the users intellect first and foremost,5,05/17/2018,8
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Stay with version 16 because this is seless. When I press F2 and F3 to  ---- decrease/increase my laptop brightness Kodi jumps all over the screen.  ---- Trying to "go back" was much easier with the right mouse/button click. I  ---- have to struggle to scroll all the way up long lists to click the tiny  ---- "back" link. This was obviously designed by some nerd who never sees the  ---- light of day and doesn't understand how real world application users  ---- operate. The designer must be the same person who developed Windows  ---- Vista/Me. Hate it. Absolute useless garbage.,4,08/04/2018,15
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,People who are saying kodi doesn't work are misunderstanding what kodi is  ---- actually for. It IS NOT designed for watching free illegal streams of  ---- copyrighted material. For its intended use _  it works perfectly on my phone  ---- (Xiaomi Redmi note 4) _  Mac _  and Android TV. The kodi forums will not even  ---- answer questions if you use a 'build' or illegal sources _  but will offer  ---- support for its intended use. Fantastic app.,5,05/07/2018,13
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Works flawless. All those complaining about kodi _  simply don't understand  ---- that kodi is only a media player. It's rather the outdated addons/builds  ---- that are buggy and not working as you please,5,08/10/2018,8
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Great app. But there is one MASSIVE turn off. I don't know if it's this version _  or my device. But there is absolutely no audio that comes through headphones. My headphones are in perfect condition _  so it's not that. Video audio - doesn't play. Interface audio - doesn't play (both work without headphones). But if this could be fixed _  it would be amazing,5,02/02/2018,90
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,It's pretty great. I have kodi on most of my devices but recently _  on my  ---- galaxy note 5 _  whenever I plug in earbuds _  I get a painfully loud static  ---- noise,3,04/19/2018,11
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Can't understand what everyone is complaining about . It works great on my Samsung Tab S2. I can access my media library which sits on a PC running Serviio (an old _  version before they ruined it!). I do already have Kodi installed on a Raspberry Pi _  so maybe being familiar with Kodi already helped a little.,5,01/12/2018,18
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,People whom rated this poorly need to educate themselves _   kodi is a media player that allows 3rd Party addons to provide the sources. You can't rate this poorly because you don't know where to get sources. Search the internet and figure it out,4,04/10/2018,31
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Random times when using this app _  it would make an extremely (even  ---- surprisingly) loud white noise sound. Have you ever changed the channel to  ---- something that didn't exist? It's that same sound. It BLEW. OUT. MY.  ---- EARBUDS. I don't know if this is a problem they're fixing on here or not. I  ---- do use this on my computer _  and it works just fine on there. As I said  ---- works fine.on the computer. I love it _  really _  but that sound needs to be  ---- fixed somehow.,1,08/15/2018,3
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Very often the app crashes _  Kodi 18.3/4/5. Links do not work properly _  freezing _  lazing etc... I went back to 17.6. It's much more stable in every aspect.,3,01/24/2020,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I was greeted to Kodi with a blast of ear-shattering static audio through my headphones. At first I thought they had broken _  until I closed Kodi and opened up YouTube. It seems that I get the loud static when I plug headphones in.,1,01/20/2018,21
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,All these people complaining about not being able to illegally pirate tv series and movies instead of using the app for what it was meant for _  accessing local media. Very neat and looks good _  will certainly recommend to others.,5,12/28/2017,51
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Thought app was so neat because you could catch up with your favorite shows but over time it has become aggravating because some of the channels will not let you watch all the way through without buffering. Really need to screen better!!,1,11/29/2017,53
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Ever since exodus went down _  this app has stunk.  Tried covenant; absolutely nothing streams and none of the fixes works.  What a POS,1,01/14/2018,24
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Im really hating this useless app. No matter what im trying to watch _  movie or show _  it always tells me no stream avaliable. What kind of bs is that.,1,12/28/2017,34
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,You suck. No ones has a tutorial for me to do add ons to watch pirated shlt through galaxy s8+,1,10/03/2018,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Just checked to see if they have fixed the issues from 6 months ago. Still has the same crashing issues. Staying with 1 star. Obviously the maker doesn't  check on here _  and I'd like other people to be aware that cutting off your cable to substitute with this is a bad idea. Also keeps making me update the app. I have literally noticed no change. Still doesn't work worth a s**t,1,11/21/2017,36
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Complete trash. Was easy to get set up and use. But wow Kodi is very  ---- outdated and inferior compared to other apps available today.,1,07/04/2018,2
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Good job kodi I give it 100000 stars i could. Who ever is updating kodi is ruining it nothing works im starting not to like it any more !!!,2,03/03/2018,7
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,3 stars until they come up with an update to stop videos from cancelling after phone has been blocked. Really annoyed by that _  but really good overall,3,12/06/2017,20
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,This app needs to be updated. Most of my movies or shows are not playing.  ---- And there's a description saying that this app contains several bugfixes. I  ---- exodus that's where I watch all my movies and TV shows it works the best,5,08/02/2018,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,When it works _  it's great.  I have very high speed internet _  which is useless as every TV show I try to watch is constantly buffering. Surprisingly some movies will load in HD _  no problems at all.  TV shows tend to be a different story though.,3,01/06/2018,6
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,This may be a great app on other platform but in Android the interface just  ---- sucks. One example is the keyboard - it wouldn't let me use the Android  ---- keyboard and insist on using the app's keyboard _  which isn't very  ---- convenient.,3,08/03/2018,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Been using since XBMC many years back. For those complaining it's simple. Learn how to use it properly. It's not designed for illegal streams. If they aren't working any more put your hand in your pocket and pay for media.,5,01/18/2018,16
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Absolutely rubbish. Doesn't work with legal stuff like YouTube and BBC iPlayer _  RT _  Sky News. etc. It's only as good as it's most unreliable add-on and there are many. Clicking add-on uninstall doesn't work for instance.,1,12/28/2017,15
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Absolute tosh! Far to complicated for  me. No step by step instructions for someone who gets overwhelmed with it. Better off with other apps that work straight away!,1,03/31/2018,7
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,The app won't open for me anymore _  it just instantly closes then when I try  ---- to open it again _  it goes to a black screen and nothing will load. I'm on a  ---- Samsung galaxy s7. I loved this app _  please fix.,2,05/23/2018,2
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Love the app _  but now & lately the app has been tripping. It's getting to the point that I want to delete it. I choose not to though I just hope they fix the hiccups with the site!,3,01/15/2018,9
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Program is open source and empty upon installation. There are many supported and unsupported add-ons which give a variety of media upon installation. Great program if you know how to use it,5,02/12/2018,8
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I believe that this is a good app. But i feel it is difficult to use it _  instead of showing all the videos i have to browse through all the folders in my phone to select the video. Also only showing the sd card _  no internal storage So uninstalling.,4,08/25/2018,0

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Kodi promises so much but delivers fak all. Kodi configurator app helpful  ---- with setup. I have only been able to negotiate play trailers as every movie  ---- stream says "no stream available". Tried pin pairing as well as getting new  ---- API without success. May try reinstall again. Or stick to strem.io and  ---- telerarium tv. Covenant and Elysium no longer work with Krypton. Is the  ---- updates that are killng the addons _  me thinks.,2,04/21/2018,3
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Crappy user interface. "Confluence HD" skin/interface is much easier to use. Use Kodi with Android TV Boxes with at least 2 GB of RAM and at least 16 GB Hard Drive space for best experience (Android TV Box is HDMI Out and will run any Android App; use Google Play Store _  Aptoide Store _  F-Droid _  Amazon App Store or UpToDown Store - all these stores are free to run [all applications from these stores will run on Android TV Boxes]). Use Rii Backlit Wireless Keyboard for best user experience on any Android TV.,4,11/19/2017,6
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Used to work great.  For several days now it crashes on start up.  Haven't  been able to figure out why.  Continually coming to the store to see if an update is necessary as in the past that has been the case _   but so far no updates available. If it ever gets working again _  it's a 5 star app.,3,11/25/2017,7
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,If you don't know how to install the builds that are out there _  then you shouldn't be writing a review. You Tube has plenty of videos on how to do it. Once you learn how easy it is to side load builds _  you will just have to pick the one you like best. Fire TV Guru works flawlessly on Android phones. That and some google research and you'll be a pro. Get a real debrid account and the sky is the limit. Happy researching 😃,5,11/15/2017,36
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Needs work I'm going back to Jarvis for a few more months! worked OK on my tablet _  but real iffy on my TV box. Jarvis ran perfect on my box. I'm sure it will all be worked out soon.........Edit as of 17.3 ...... Kodi is running way better than when I posted the original review. Kodi is the best software on all my android devices. It was so nice after years and years of being screwed over by cable companies to finally have another option! Make sure and tweak your system so that kodi runs best for your needs. If you can hardline to your modem I suggest that _  but depending on your router and wifi service provider wifi works decent. All in all keep up the great work developers.,5,09/05/2018,2
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Seems like all the most useful platforms are open source. If only folks  ---- would do with voting machines what KODI has done with media _  and get  ---- politicians to agree to install them nationwide _  the United States  ---- Constitution might have some kind of chance to survive the next 20 years.,5,06/09/2018,3
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,V17.6 is working well on Samsung chrome book and on Nexus 6 as well as fire stick. Many add-ons have been left unsupported or in updated if not taken down. Had to reformat and delete many add-ons and replaced. This app is very convenient to use with all kinds of media and streams. Please don't blame the app if you don't understand it. The app itself works great. Some 3rd party options have issues _  please don't blame the app developers.,5,11/16/2017,25
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,This app is not working at all for me now _  I click on a movie to open and  ---- it says no streams available. I will even click on a movie that I have  ---- watched before and it says no streams available _  so I don't know why it's  ---- not working. I don't want to delete it and then reinstall it because that's  ---- too much work I have to go through YouTube to know how to reinstall it  ---- again what do I do. Otherwise I love using this app.,2,05/22/2018,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,17/01/06 So far so good. I have yet to have any issues with any of my devices. 18/02/10 Over a year and still no issues   PS. TO EVERYONE USING ADD-ONS THE DEVELOPERS OF KODI HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH MOST ADD-ONS. MESSAGE THE ADD-ON DEV TEAM FOR HELP INSTEAD.,5,02/10/2018,2
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,It gives me the freedom to choose the tv shows and movies I want to see for  ---- free. The only downsides are 1. Its hard to configure it once downloaded  ---- and 2. Everything takes a long time to load at first,4,08/05/2018,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,As for a few people complaining there is. no back button on pc.. Instead of scrolling up to tbe dots to go back a pack right click your mouse that also brings you back one page at a time until tbe first page then you gotta click on the dots.. My opinion of kodi is maybe for some it could be a bit of a challenge to configure and set up addons etc but once you get to know the program its awesome now if we can just cut the internet companies outta tbe equation we'd be in an awesome place..,5,12/19/2017,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,For all those complaining that can't get their TV shows etc _  Kodi is just a  ---- media server. TV shows and films etc come from add-ons that need to be  ---- installed. These add-ons are not licenced or affiliated with Kodi in any  ---- way. For builds and add-ons you need to search Google. Kodi will not answer  ---- your questions regarding add-ons. Some people obviously don't know how to  ---- use Kodi and don't know what the hell they are talking about. Kodi itself  ---- works fine. Your add-ons are the problem.,5,08/20/2018,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,This app is what everyone should have. If you enjoy sharing media this is the best thing for that. And the greedy cable company's would like nothing more than to ban it.

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I don't get it I want to watch movies but how do you get them up. This app  ---- is over complicated. There are much better free movie apps out there. Don't  ---- bother downloading it's a waste of time. I'm now going to uninstal,1,05/31/2018,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,i've just rebooted my 96mini and i cannot find 17.6 krypton. It's what i know how to use. Liea 18 seems to be great but im having problems finding my way around.

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Love Kodi and just installed it on my MiBox (Official Android TV Device) and under addons it shows all my Android apps.  How do I had just the Android Apps?  Being on Android TV I would rather use it by default for going to other apps.  Can't seem to find a way to change it and its pure cosmetic I know but irks me lol.,3,02/19/2018,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Since the update on 11/14/2017 the freaking app won't even load anymore. I click the app and then nothing but a black screen for a while _  then the app closes. Well it was fun while it lasted _  now it is  useless. Hopefully the next update will fix this insanity.,1,12/01/2017,3
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,It worked great until about a year ago. We didn't get to new version on Android and now it either won't play anything or asks you to visit a website to register for certain sites every single time you use it. Idk if Kodi is broken or just exodus.,3,03/11/2018,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Awesome...  I used to use crackle and tubi (which are good apps themselves) until I found out about kodi + exodus. This is hands down the best entertainment app I ever used. Completely free and no adds either.,5,01/06/2018,3
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Great app... To answer any questions for bugs or just not working... Reinstall Kodi on your Android device and YouTube how to install the program _  and there you have you'll thank me later.,5,11/15/2017,9
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,After Jarvis this is impossible to view video without stutter and off sync sound from my network at home. I don't use add-ons or streams just my own content which works fine on other programs and devices. Install Kodi 17.** And it just doesn't cooperate on Android box or tablets. Going back to mplayer,1,04/07/2018,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,This is _  in my opinion _  the best open source video player ever to be made. Kodi will remain my favorite player until phones and PCs are obsolete.,5,02/04/2018,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Great app _  great features. Ecxellent support for third party add-ons. Any  ---- negative reviews probably based upon the assumption that this app comes  ---- with these third party add-ons _  or a bug caused by these add-ons. All in  ---- all it is a great player as is _  and is completely free.,5,08/18/2018,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,DOESN'T HAVE LIVE CHANNELS THIS APP IS FALSE ADVERTISING ALL IT IS _  IS A LINK APP TO WEBSITES WITH VIDEO AND MOVIE CLIPS! IF YOU WANT LIVE TV YOU MUST BUY THEN DOWNLOAD A HUGE AMOUNT OF OTHER PROGRAMS AND LEARN HOW TO BECOME A PROGRAMER TO INSTALL THE PROGRAMS! AT THAT RATE YOU MIGHT AS WELL JUST BUY A CABLE/SAT SERVICE THEN USE THEY'RE APPS! IT ENDS UP BEING CHEAPER IN LONG RUN,1,03/06/2018,5
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,No problem till the new update from the playstore. Now I get popups every 2  ---- seconds. Another popup as I was writing this review. I was going to say you  ---- should work at McDonald's but you would probably suck at that too.,1,08/14/2018,0

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,buggier on each update. So kodi updated itself to v18 _  and now it just crashes after 2 seconds of starting up.

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I really would to give to this App 5 stars but isn't well coded for Android  ---- and the interface doesn't adapt to different screens configurations.

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,The app for android TV is good but there is huge problem. There is no way to go back from anywhere.

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Nice app but since 17 update _  I have found nothing but problems. Hard to find a good stream. As for the person with exodus issues _  you really need to read up on google and kodi website _  exodus is no longer available so you need to install covenant. Same interface but a lot better. Room for a lot of improvement on Kodi but still tolerable and usable. Lets get Kodi back to old school guys and make this app great like it used to be.,4,11/22/2017,5
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I find it annoying the number of users complaining about not being able to get plugins working. It's like complaining about android because you don't like an app. Kodi is an excellent media player which is highly customizable. I'm not a fan of the latest skin _  so I use xonfluence. That's my point _  if you don't like it you can change it. Give the developers some credit for and excellent media center _  ported to android. If YOU don't have the ability to use it _  or the inclination to learn how to _  don't blame the app.,5,11/12/2017,26
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,the app cuntinues to crash without warning and doesn't alow me to exit the show i'm watching to get anotherone. regardless on weather im on the app or not i still get random notifications telling me that it's crashed. i have also attepted to watch a show and alwasy get the same episode. i have tried to watch half of bob's burgers season 6 and it continues to play the same episode. i'm trying to re download now...hopefully i get a better result.,2,11/14/2017,6
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Just to say. Some people may or may not know. But he reason this app may not work is because there has been a new update coded LEIA and he reason is that people are trying to shut this app down. I have the box and exodus doesn't work. It used to be an amazing app but the movies don't work. If anyone can help me to re-program it on he box that would be really useful.,4,11/09/2017,45
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,So is this the end? Like 90% of new links I've added dont work and there's always no source updated as well... I've added like every movie addon and only some movies or links work now.,2,11/10/2017,13
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Addons wont work.  Keeps saying it can't connect.   Watched and read countless "fixed" videos and threads and they all have not been any help.  I checked the url and they go where they should with the zip file _  but they don't work when adding on.  My network connection is not the issue _   and it isn't spelling or spaces issues.,1,10/31/2017,115
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Everytime I open the app all I get is an ear-piercing static noise _  it has scared me so many times. I'm not sure what the hell is going on but it's honestly disappointing.,1,11/09/2017,26
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I heard that this app work and it's very popular. But I couldn't get it to work the interface is very bad and outdated.  I tried some tutorial on YouTube but it just didn't work for me I'm very dissapointed !I wish if it was a modern design (material design),1,11/11/2017,4
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,It's a few things that's bothersome _  like if u accidentally click your screen off _  you have to go through the trouble of finding the link again and loading takes a few minutes to do. No closed captioning you have to download but they're isn't an option to even do that. Its just hassles still give 4 stars one of a kind though.,4,11/06/2017,10
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,To all of the people complaining about exodus being gone and covenant not being that great.... Kodi ( XBMC) does not produce the pirated streams you are complaining about.  Understand how the application works _  before you review it.,5,11/17/2017,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,1 star because you have user error is ridiculous. 1 star because "it works on this but not this" is as well. I have kodi on 4 devices and it is so much better than alternatives _  with timely updates. I hope it's around for years to come _  and I hope reviewers smarten up.,5,11/10/2017,8
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Kodi has always been great _  few issues if any at all. Open source _  cross platform support. The list is endless _  can use add-ons and well all features on any platform. Don't use as much on phone _  as PC because of the tiny display but I may start using more and more when I'm away from home. Great to have Kodi where ever I go in life. :),5,10/28/2017,78
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Love it. The 1*s reviews I'm sorry is your FREE app not connecting you to the ILLEGAL movies & sports you want to watch. Anyone who thinks its a simple case of click n play like a sky box should stay away & to the people who paid £30 or more for a box with this on. I'm not even going there.,5,11/04/2017,5
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I've been using this application's platform for quite a few years. Third party add-ons made this"more popular" _  but true Kodi lovers should learn how to put their movies and TV shows via DVDs on here. It's not only safer _  but much better and you don't rely on sources that could be malicious. Also _  play around with the interface. It's the absolute most brilliant thing I've ever come into contact with as a gamer and cinema enthusiast. Please _  for those who don't use it for the good _  remember this is not meant to have stuff already on it.,5,02/18/2018,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Used to love this app buy now it doesn't work. New build is garbage. Wish I could revert back to the old one. Can't select anything and all my add ons and repository disappeared,1,11/03/2017,13
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Love Kodi! I've been using it since the XBMC days on my first gen Xbox. Since then I've used it on numerous devices and there is simply no better way to enjoy your media.,5,10/29/2017,25
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,People who are saying it doesn't work you're dumb. You just need to refresh your sources every once in a while us different add-ons it's not like there is a limit and that's what I love about kodi is as long as you're not retarded and can use it properly it works properly. Thanks for continuing to support the platform!,5,11/05/2017,11
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Brilliant. Only thing that I'd change is for large lists on my phone if you dont select the option in the centre it can misclick (same with last phone) but perfect on tablets and pc,5,10/28/2017,16
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I don't understand the negative reviews on this app.  It works perfect if you can't get it to work go back to netflix cause you're not smart enough for Kodi.,5,10/31/2017,22
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,It's bad. The interface is an absolute abomination to use on a touchscreen. Buttons are way too small. The only reason to endure this is those add-ons that allows for easy pirated content. Google should remove this from the store.,1,11/14/2017,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,It hangs while watching video and setting up is a bit complicated.addons also doesn't work smoothly.and rest everything is good _ open network and works on all devices.please add internal memory option to directly play videos from the device memory.,4,10/31/2017,4
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,(edit) Works a treat. The smartphone touch screen works reasonably well. Thanks for all the work and effort you put into it. (end edit).  Works great and I can access all music _  pictures _  videos on my main kodi PC. Thanks. I have a DVB TV card on my PC and can watch live TV from that. Also _  Recorded TV works fine and I schedule recordings too. Fantastic to have it on my phone.,5,11/15/2017,313
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,The built in media player is bad _  there is no way to easily skip back 10 seconds or 30 seconds and instead of buffering it just skips forward and the audio cuts out. When it skips you miss out on dialog and visuals,2,11/01/2017,8
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I wish I could give negative stars.  I honestly don't understand the hype.  All of the 'add ons' either glitch _  are empty _  or are in German.  The interface is WAY too sensitive making touching an item near impossible and very frustrating... And would it kill them to include a 'back Button' for phones that don't have a hard back button?,1,11/11/2017,2
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,A love hate thing - some days it rules and other days all I want is to kill it! IF THE ADDONS WERE RELIABLE I WOULD MARRY KODI!!Until then KODI will remain being my BFF.,4,11/17/2017,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Was a great app.  Now literally won't open on my phone.  Just opens and closes immediately or goes to a completely black screen.  Nothing works....😢,3,11/14/2017,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,This is it: We only need a (good) internet connection _  customize Kodi _  add your favorite add-ons and watch free TV forever. You need no TV subscriptions at all,5,10/29/2017,9
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Add ons wont work. I have done all the fix videos and nothing. I deleted and downloaded again just to see if that fixed the issue and it didnt. Disappointed  that it doesnt work after reading all the good reviews.,1,11/02/2017,5
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Latest update fails to launch on Nexus Player running Oreo. Update: Issue was promptly fixed. Hope this type of oversight doesnt happen again. Thanks!,4,11/02/2017,6
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Simply amazing the power of this app when modified with third party add-ons.  Very legitimate world power here for all things visual audio entertainment.   Thank you for the great application. Very impressed.,5,11/07/2017,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Opens with words and thumbnails stretched as if on wide screen. Also doesn't allow me to select specific options ex. pressing addons will highlight a different selection,1,10/28/2017,4
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Best app to watch videos you own or movies. Media player. This is not for streaming but can be used for it. All you who have issues can't blame the app when it really not suppose to do it any ways. (I stick to 17.3 for my stuff). Maybe you should not update. Currently find nothing wrong with 17.3.,5,11/19/2017,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I love this app. Yeah it has problems time to time but it's free and no ads. Works great for me just about every single time I use it.,5,11/13/2017,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,New update broke it on my Motorola G3. I can't click on options I can only scroll through awkwardly. Please fix!,1,10/30/2017,6
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,99.9% of the time the app doesn't even launch and everytime it does launch it just freezes and it's updated I refuse to rate it anything higher until it's fixed.,1,11/02/2017,2
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Awesome App It give you lots OF Oppurtunity to BE Creative With Every Aspect of THE APP. A full Open Type Platform.,5,10/28/2017,4
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,After getting kodi downloaded on my firestick to work I manage to download it on my phone with no problems. I love it to death and wish the kodi upgrades were automatic. But it's all good now!,5,10/28/2017,11
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Feel and experience i bad compared to 16  Hangs and crashes  Does not support old platform.,1,02/06/2018,5
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I'm very supportive of this app for nearly 2 years now. Wish it had an pro version of this app for $2 without no ad's _  more options and so forth to give money for developers,5,11/04/2017,3
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,It does what i need it to do but when I plug my headphones into listen to a video all I get is complete static!!!! The only way to watch anything is to watch it without my headphones which is a huge problem!,3,10/30/2017,5
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,It's a great app can't wait to finally get to watch all the movies and shows I want on my phone !!! &lt;3,5,10/28/2017,11
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,When updated why the gogoanime sourse file can't watch I'm not patient to wait so long,2,11/06/2017,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Awesome _  a lil slow in loading movies _  don't know how to work the free tv if some one can help me _  love it tho,5,11/24/2017,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Trash app. Was working fine and now seems to be no fix for the loud static sound. Yet it works great on a desktop.,1,11/14/2017,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Love Kodi and all the things you can do with this app. So then why did I  ---- rate it a 2?! Because the developers have done nothing about fixing the  ---- issues of displaying and using this app on a chromebook. I am a diehard  ---- kodi enthusist _  but when you can't support or fix the issues (the control  ---- bar and controls can't be accessed because full screen won't allow it to be  ---- displayed on the screen) for chromebook users. . . you can only wait for so  ---- long. Then _  it's time to move on to something else. At the moment _  because  ---- Kodi's developers haven't done a thing about it. . . I left the platform  ---- and no longer reccomend it to others. I now use lockers that allow me to  ---- stream my content. Again _  If the dev team fixes the issue . . . I would  ---- gladly go back to the app _  but at the moment _  I can't use it on a chrome  ---- book. . . which is ironic.

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Well used.  Some people have issues but it plays every movie file I have tried.  No swipe on screen but take time to learn and it may surprise you.  As good as VLC without the laggness that comes with most current version.  Thanks for a great player.  Even functions good on full DVD.iso files.,4,10/23/2017,4
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Soon as I opened the app (with my earphones in) I was greeted with intense ear rape... I closed the app and the sound was gone. The sound would leave if I took out my earphones or closed the app. I know this isn't a problem on my behalf because I've tried using kodi with different types of earphones also I dont seem to have this problem on any other apps. XBMC _  wyd???,2,08/26/2017,569
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,It used to be a halfway decent app but lately it's garbage. Link no longer work _  video take forever to load _  videos choppy and buffering ever 30 seconds if I'm lucky. Just strait garbage. Time to go back to netflix and Hulu. They at least work the way they are supposed too,1,08/28/2017,402
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Would give 0 stars if i could. Installed on my new android tv. Woked great for a few days _  now it constantly freezes _  locks up and is completely unusable. Thoight it might be an issue due to a build I installed _  so I cleared the cache _  cleared all data _  uninstalled _  cleared all cached data from storage and reinstalled. Frozen _  buggy _  unuseable app. Very disappointed.,1,09/04/2017,294
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Many brilliant features makes this the best platform available.  Criticisms:  1. Pausing for some time closes movie _  need to find then resume 2. Mouse too sensitive _  small movement reveals navigation bar 3. I don't want to see progress bar when accessing controls _  no option to hide progress 4. Cannot edit SAMBA configuration within app. Network access very slow.,4,09/18/2017,28
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Loved the App the way it was before the Krypton 17.0 Update.... They have totally ruined the simplicity I had come to love about the service.. The new interface is dysfunctional and cluttered and it's so difficult to find the add-ons and services I use and the new update is miserable! Bring back the version and interface I had come to appreciate!,5,08/27/2017,123
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I really love this app _  but it won't open.. Like _  at all. And no way in hell am I uninstalling it. It took me forever to get this one thing _  you're funny if you think I'm going through that again.,1,10/19/2017,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I adore this app. It is a great way to listen to your music _  watch tv and movies and even listen to the radio. It sometimes crashes before you open it _  but im willing to look past that as i could just open kodi on my pc. Just make they keyboard bigger (the virtual keyboard) _  it is really hard to enter the right characters,5,10/09/2017,12
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,This would have been great if this update didnt come out _  i was watching on the old update then it kicked me off. #alert this entire app is a waste of time it wont help delete it while you can...,1,09/08/2017,23
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Don't waste your time.  Its garbage. 17.1Kodi. Is the ass of all asses.   It loads fine and I even got as far as dowloading exodus but it freezes up.  No it's not my device. Im running it on or should say was running it on a LG G4 With 6.0 operating system and the phone is amazing.  Its this version of Kodi that sucks,1,10/08/2017,7
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I'd give 10 stars if I could. For someone with a large video library _  Kodi is Nirvana. The way it organises and displays movie & TV shows from my NAS _  the watched lists _  & customisation _  just to name a few _  is fantastic. I use it every day on my Android TV box _  and keep discovering new things. Thank you for all your hard work Team Kodi. Now if you could just fix the DTS HD & True HD issue ...,5,10/05/2017,4
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Kodi was great.... Right until Krypton fell upon its users... XBMC foundation had something going till now. Since the release of the new UI occompanied with Krypton _  Kodi has become an unusable mess. I can't click on what I'm searching cause the app is registering my touches miles off from where I physically touched. If you guys fix this then I'll be happy to use it again.,1,08/26/2017,69
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,used to love this app when exodus was on there.  now that covenant took over for exodus hate it.  half the links dont have streams. is there anything better than covenant to use as the add on for kodi to watch t.v and movies?,3,10/10/2017,7
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Tried to download to my mobile device _  as soon as it opened all you could hear was a loud staticky noise. Disappointed. Love this app on my firestick. Please fix,1,10/09/2017,8
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,The app was working great now all of a sudden it won't even open or load. What can I do to get the app to work? I reset my phone and reset the app 3 times and still nothing.. Really disappointed!,3,09/12/2017,13
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,The app is crashing _  I can't even open it. I have uninstalled it and reinstalled it once already _  and it's a lot of work to put your add ons back in. Help,3,09/26/2017,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Loved it until the 17.5 update killed it. Wont even start just force closes right away. Tried rebooting device _  still wont start. Previous version worked beautifully. Please fix asap! Reverting in the meantime.,1,10/24/2017,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,It worked at first. Then it just stopped working correctly. I can't seem to watch anything on it. Nothing will load. Too many error messages. It shuts down from out of the blue. Idk what changed _  but it's horrible.,1,09/02/2017,29
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Ok XBMC Foundation. Are you going to keep ignoring your costumers!!  You'll have complaints everywhere about Kodi not working _ updating and just messing up for a while now. It looks like your not interested in keeping costumers.,1,10/01/2017,7
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Jarvis was awesome but since we got the new Krypton version _  it is garbage. Links don't work _  loads of buffering and sometimes the app even crashes. I NEED MY OLD KODI BACK ! :(,1,09/12/2017,11

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,This is great _  top quality app. Been using this for years now _  phone _  tablets _  laptops and Tv's its great. Works anywhere with internet really _  and obversly a little know-how. To any that says this app doesn't work _  freezes or buffers and so on... you clearly shouldn't be using this app as you don't have the understanding to sort it out and keep it updated. You should go and use Netflix and Amazon _  there made for idiot's you can't lose.,5,06/12/2017,608
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I think its one of the greatest apps ever created _  there is nothing you can't watch...anyone having buffering issues may want to consider using a vpn service. Nothing wrong with the 17.3 at all. And really _  how can anyone complain about a free app?!? The amount of hours spent creating and updating this is much appreciated!!!,5,08/09/2017,133
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Bit of a learning curb at first but loving it more and more as I learn to use it and setup the Addons _  etc. Still a little more tweaking required that I'm finding out about with the help of all the videos on YouTube. Unfortunately got a lot of unwanted porn installed in the beginning which I easily deleted. These Android TV Boxes and Streaming videos is definitely the way of future entertainment viewing. Apparently there are Kodi replacements but so far I'm sticking with it. Highly recommended!,5,08/16/2017,24
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,The best media player ever made. I got hooked on the first time I was I introduced to it few years ago. Anyone who gives this app less than five stars should immediately stop using it and un-install it from there system. I have Kodi installed on all my PCs and mobile phones and tablets.,5,08/22/2017,301
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I honestly loved kodi... Atleast Until the krypton 17.3 update. At first it was okay not to complicated to use _  but for some reason after a few months it slowly started failing me. At first it was the buffering _  then it started to slow down when finding streams. I thought maybe it was my phone _  but definitely not. Now I find NONE of the repositories I used to use work. I tried different add-ons _  but still nothing!!,2,06/14/2017,671
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I have read a few reviews about videos not playing or addons not working properly. In fairness you have to understand that many addons have shut down recently or have moved to a different server. This has nothing to do with kodi as it is only a platform. I find kodi great and am grateful to the developers for their time spent on it. My advice for those having problems is to look for alternative addons.,5,08/17/2017,384
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Having problems when using headphones/ earphones on note 5 nougat. You can only hear noises when using the audio jack. Even just navigating the menu produce noises. Other video/audio players working fine. Sound is ok when using the built in speaker. I confirm that unplugging and plugging back the jack stops the noise. Hopefully will be fixed on next release.,2,05/26/2017,440
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,3rd edit on my review. I really hate this app now. Getting this app to work it like pulling teeth. I have 4G network. It used to work great for me. But after the updates and what not the damn thing just went to hell. It doesn't want to load anything. Doesn't want to do anything. I can't watch anything anymore. Movies or shows without issues. Movies it cuts off. Shows it buffers so bad and cuts in and out ridiculously. I've reinstalled like 4 times and it's the same thing. I'm about to give up all together on this app.,1,07/31/2017,37
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Trash after the update. The complicated ui is not productive at all. Videos buffer all the time. Buttons such as pause or rewind sometimes don't work. Subtitles rarely work properly. Certain providers require authorisation. I don't like how you have to load the video again if the screen times out. And absolutely worst of all: It causes horrible static noise from hell through the headphones making them useless when the app is running...even in background. Such a mess and it could be soo good.,1,05/28/2017,176
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Loved it at first. But y'all lemme tell you as soon as I downloaded the most recent update I started to hate it. I was jammin' out to some music loud with my headsets in _  okay _  and them I'm like "Hmm I wanna watch something" so I open up Kodi and the most startling screeching horrific static noise comes through my speakers. If I was a cat I woulda been down to four lives. Basically if this was GTA my armor would have been gone after that. Crazy af.,2,05/30/2017,324
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Worked well until recently. Now it's mostly 'unable to connect' or 'no stream available' for movie and show add-ons. Other add-ons _  mostly channel specific for some basic cable stations _  still work. Needs a new crop of providers as the old go down and out.,2,06/10/2017,55
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I like this app on other than cell phones. I have installed it on 2 devises (note 5 and s7 edge) and on both it gives very loud headphone static on one side once the app starts. Please fix this issue. For know im using popcorn time.,3,08/14/2017,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,So Exodus has been removed in the 17.2 update? It came back in 17.3 update but still doesn't show up when you install it. Also _  I have updates _  but when I choose update _  it says I don't have updates. Ever since the crackdown on Kodi it's been out of wack. That's why I don't like to update these kind of applications when they work just fine _  but forced to because the nature of the application and function.,1,05/29/2017,146
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Clicked "TV" in the app hoping for live channels but only got presented a link to a blurb of an endless list of add ons that need to be installed before anything is working. Complicated and for fiddlers only (if it actually works after completing the manual add on installation marathon).,2,06/26/2017,31
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I still love Kodi but now I can't imatall from the zip file at all _  I can't do anything. I wish it would be fixed right now so I can watch my little pony _  being human _  bitten _  and other stuff again instead of using the damn box that came with Kodi.,1,07/01/2017,27
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Usually I absolutely love this app but these days I cant search anything _  I have to go throug back channels to just watch an episode. This was never the case. I don't know what changed but it is making the app unusable. Unfortunately it is not just me _  my family members experience the same thing on multiple devices. Please see if this can be fixed _  because this is a great app.,1,10/08/2017,10
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Excellent app. The only thing I don't like is about when I pause the movie. If the phone goes into sleep mode while paused _  it goes back out to the main screen when you wake the phone up _  and you have to find the show again and start it over. It won't stay on your paused screen after waking up. Other than that _  it's the only movie app you'll ever need.,4,07/01/2017,13
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,The version 17 is a big step back. There is no FF and no RWD button anymore. It is very very user UNfriendly _  and on the Top of all these the Static Noise through headphone is The Worst.  But overall I still do like this app.,3,08/10/2017,4
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Was fine until a couple months ago. Runs really slow and I haven't been able to watch an episode of anything. Even when going under new episodes. I like movies but if I wanted only movies I'd of downloaded just a movie app. Please fix this.,1,07/28/2017,6
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Very polished app. Although advertised as a media center _  you can easily use it as a simple media player. It looks like a direct port from a desktop version _  as there is a dizzying set of features and functionality that aren't necessarily pertinent to an Android tablet. I wish it was customized for Android a bit more (e.g. please allow us to disable immersive mode; some of us like Android's notification bar and bottom navigation bar). It appears to be totally free and I saw no ads of any kind. Thanks!,5,07/13/2017,19
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,This app worked fine on my Moto g4 plus phone.  However _  it now will not work on the Moto g5 plus.  I've installed repo & fusion _  but when I open the zip files _  there's nothing there!  So frustrating!  I can add TV channels from the Kodi repository _  but that's all!  I'd like to see movies.  Can't find a fix to this empty zip file problem anywhere.  Moto g5 plus uses Android 7 _  nougat OS.  Not sure if that's the problem _  shouldn't be. I can watch TV at home on my cable box!,2,07/15/2017,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Two stars because this is genuinely a good app so I'll overlook the problems slightly more. There are too many problems with this app. Pls fix. It WAS a really great app... make sure it stays that way. The problems are the pause and rewind buttons _  what's wrong with them? Extremely annoying. Problems with buffering _  it's horrible. Sometimes when I click on the app it just exits it straight away. Then when I click it again _  it doesn't exit the app however a black screen appears and nothing happens. FIX!,2,06/15/2017,6
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,At no time have ever got this to work it just keeps telling me failed to play look at logs to see why.  Kodi has never worked on any device I have tried to put it on from macs to pc to android there was always some reason it wouldn't start or won't play.  I know people who have this application they look at mine and can't figure out what the problem is.  They would install it exactly the way they put their app on the exact same device and it won't work.  All I hear is it works on mine. What matters is it don't work on mine no casting doesn't help ether,1,06/10/2017,38
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,It's a really good app. The only thing I don't like about it is the fact that every time you pause the movie to go to something else _  or when my phone goes to sleep _  I have to start the movie or show over because it don't show a resume option. That really needs to be fixed. Other than that _  it's awesome.,4,07/26/2017,2
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Nicely done peice of software. Wish my paid TV box was like this. Really _  content providers should strive to provide customers their media in this way. If they would just streamline licensing purchases on the fly _  and allow folks to stream movies and shows to their digital devices at a reasonable price... But they would rather spend the money to avoid change and progress.  Kodi media player is not the problem _  the problem is the internet _  which allows free thinking​ to create a more robust and functional media player than content providers _  for free.,4,06/30/2017,10
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,It does switch on. However _  after a while it will get stuck in between the movie and say that there is something wrong with the app.  After all it does give good quality tv shows and movies,3,06/11/2017,15
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Static at top volume _  static even with sound on mute _  static just opening kodi even when not playing anything.  Screeching high volume static. Please fix. I can't turn it off without closing app. Making kodi now unusable.,2,06/05/2017,29
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I don't know if anyone else is having this problem _  but this app used to run so well now it won't even open. First it opens the app _  then closes _  and the second time I try to open it i just get a black screen.  I have a galaxy tab A _  and it would be great if this problem was fixed,2,06/20/2017,20
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Okay _  I have this feature on my television and it works well. Early releases on latest movies _  good quality _  (sometimes) and I thought I could download this app on my phone because I could watch movies in my room to my content. I opened the app with headphones in _  and immediately after opening this HORRIBLE screeching sound came at FULL VOLUME into my ears. I turned my volume down to 0 _  but the noise persisted at the same insane volume. I could hear it in my headphones when I set them 20 inches from myself. It sounded like a screeching banshee from a horror film. Could the developer tell me what is wrong? I know this is not a one time thing because I uninstalled and turned it on again _  and the same thing happened. I would really like some intellectual answers _  because I have yet to find a good movie player app _  and I was looking forward to this one.,1,06/20/2017,29
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I used to use kodi for absolutely everything. It was so damn good. Now all the addons are garbage and don't work _  and the layout is terrible. Krypton ruined kodi and its so disappointing,1,09/24/2017,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Loved kodi before the krypton update.  Since the last update i cant listen on my earphones. As soon as i open the app really loud white noise blasts through them. Annoying...,2,07/01/2017,15
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Ever since I updated to Nougat _  Kodi keeps making loud static noise when earphones are plugged in. It sometimes stops when I unplug the earphones and plug them back in. I made a quick Google search and found that others are have the same problems too.,1,05/24/2017,113
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I've had the app a while now and it started out great. Now I can only access tv shows and a few movies that appear to have been downloaded or favorited. I don't know why and the app forum is too confusing for this book worm...,3,06/07/2017,12
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,All the people saying this app don't work _  are doing so because they're using illegal add-ons that stopped working and they don't know how to fix it or they just don't understand what the app is for in general. This app still works perfect for its intended purposes!,5,06/21/2017,14
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I am uninstalling this simply because it does not give me the option for full screen again every time I accidentally hit a button that go back to the main menu. For example _  while watching a video _  I hit the home button and cannot go back continue watching that video. The display is stuck with the main menu with is such a bad design. It should at least provide a back button so if I hit a wrong button then I can go back.,1,07/16/2017,9
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I use to brag about this app _  but as of late _  there is hardly anything to brag about. Videos that once played _  doesn't play anymore _  or I simply can't find them. Certain streams will play _  then will start to buffer _  and next thing you know _  it becomes an unplayable stream. Can't understand how updates have made the app such a crappy mess. Think I'm deleting it ASAP. It was fun while it lasted _  and to freaking good to be true. I guess you'll be advertising a paid version that works better in the near future. I can see it coming!,1,06/22/2017,68
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Rubbish. It's not the apps fault it's the fact that the streaming has been sh it down. Basically you can't put a wizard on it now. Wookie didn't work and neither did another one I tried. Without a build this app is useless. I really did used to enjoy it too. Will look harder for a build that works but not too hard cos I can't be that bothered. If anyone has a build that works then please share the wealth but for now uninstalled on my phone and I'll have to hope my other methods continue to work until that is shut down too.,1,06/22/2017,15
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,The all works great except the issue where you can't use headphones without a high pitch and very loud static sounds almost blowing out your ears. Makes the app unusable if you are in a public place. Please  fix this issue,2,07/21/2017,3
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,This app SUCKS. It is so hard to set anything up. I had the worst experience. I stayed with the phone for HOURS and wasn't able to do ANYTHING.  I recommend you DO NOT get this app.,1,06/27/2017,6
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Updated it to the latest version all fine before then now when i open it no audio from phone speakers and when using earphones crrates horrendous static noise at max volumes screaming in my ears actually hurt my hearing all i can hear now is ringing. Dangerous you have traded internet safety for health.,1,06/01/2017,32
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Kodi isn't for everybody. If you know what you're doing its great. For those giving bad reviews _   please remember that Kodi takes time and effort to understand and use. No one will maintain it for you. It is a free service.  Addons crash _   switch places and so on.  You have to know what to do to make it all work again when there are problems. Have been using it for years.,5,07/04/2017,5
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Problem on mate 7 gold device _  app opens and closes immediately  _ did clear data and memory on phone also installed latest update. Please advise as to what may be the cause of the issue,1,05/26/2017,21
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I want to give it a good review but my phone is the lg aristo but when I open it the 3rd time without closing it screeches loudly. And anything I try to watch screeches to the point I must shut it down. I've uninstalled and reinstalled but still makes the sound. Please fix,4,07/19/2017,4
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Used to love using it until the latest update. Nothing would work _  it was either the film's would work for 10mins then randomly shut down or they just didn't work at all. So I uninstalled it then when I tried to reinstall exodus on it the zip file for fusion was empty even after I followed the instructions correctly. Either sort it all out or you ain't going to have anyone using your app. After a bit of research I found another add-on like fusion that has exodus this time I was able to install it but when i go to look for a tv show or film nothing happens. You wanna check the coding you have done to see if it is messing with some of the older bits of the code.,1,06/17/2017,10
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,If you dont know about kodi yet be prepared to have your senses tickled for awesomeness!! And if your having trouble that nothing is working then the usual culprits now are your Internet provider blocking or the repository's need updating.,5,08/16/2017,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I don't know what is happening. Bt everytime i am trying to install an addon it says that their is a problem with my internet although my internet is perfectly fine. Also i ve tried reinstalling. Bt every time same error pop up shows up. Nw m doomed that what m i suppose to do. Cuz ive used this app before on my same device and it use to work fine. Bt this time if i attempt on installing any addon. This pop up shows up. Saying "couldn't connect to network server" where as my net is perfectly fine with a decent speed. Very very disappointed with the app.,1,08/05/2017,2
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,older kodi's ran great but since 17 _  kodi does not run smooth anymore once you start adding stuff into it and is extremely slow _  jams freezes etc alot.,2,06/12/2017,10
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Every single time I go to my add-ons the app crashes. Can't even use it. Gave it 2 stars for a good design interface. Please resolve!!  I'm dying to use it on my Pixel XL.,2,07/08/2017,8
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Once you got the right build _  yes its is easy to use. Been a fan of Kodi  ---- since day one on my xbox. A few glitches here and there _  its all on your  ---- draw of hands. All I recommend is uninstall and try again.,5,05/01/2018,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,When I 1st got this app it wasn awesome. Now it's just more annoying when it won't play anymore. It takes a min to pick an episode and if you're lucky it will play. I can never watch a movie bc it won't load. And if it does there are Chinese subtitles that won't go away. We've tried everything. And on 4 different type of phone. Including brand new phones. Idk what happened to this app. It started out great to really pissing me off.,3,06/15/2017,9
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Best media player out there! There's no such thing as leagel free movies. The add-ons that provide that are not what Kodi OS about and shouldn't be used as such. People give this a and it's devs a bad name when they leave reviews saying they use this app for such reasons. Keep up the great work guys!,5,06/02/2017,25
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Would love to say i love this app _  because j do on every other device.. But on my Google pixel _  it won't even install any of the addons :( help _  and give me an update so i can have addons! If not _  it'll probably be deleted if i can't :(,3,06/19/2017,8
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I loved kodi until it became much more complicated and extremely buggy with the Krypton update. I have hoped it would get fixed but only gets worse sadly. Nothing like it was. Miss my 5 star app.,2,06/29/2017,7
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,This app is amazing _  allows me to watch things when I want but when I start the app I get an annoying _  loud static noise sound with my headphones plugged in since I updated. I the sound of fixed _  I will give 5 stars!,3,05/30/2017,17
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Dish network filed a lawsuit against kodi making third party add-ons to pull the plug on this app. Some add-ons still work though just need to find them,3,06/08/2017,22
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Terrible app _   can't believe it has such a high rating! Must be paid _  fake reviews! It always crashes _  that is if it will even load anything. Don't waste your time!!!!,1,07/16/2017,2
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,This was the app I had loved for movies and shows _  until one night I opened Kodi with my headphones in and it set out the worst high pitched screech and static. Changing the volume didn't help and I could only hear ringing for five or more minutes. I have a Galaxy S6 and have never heard such a deafening sound from Kodi before the recent update. Hopefully a new update will change this _  if not I will uninstall. Shameful _  really _  it was so nice.,2,06/25/2017,9
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Love Kodi. Not a fan of the new skin at all. I been using Kodi since it was XBMC on XBox.  New skin is difficult to learn. But _  ok once you have learned it. I prefer confluence.  Other than that it's awesome as usually. What more is there to say.,5,06/18/2017,35
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Not sure what the problem is. This app worked before whatever you all did. I reinstalled the app and tried multiple add ons that people said worked great for them . When I go to install from zip file and choose the source it only shows 2 little dots. I don't have an option to do anything else or get to the next step . Can someone help me please?,1,08/03/2017,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,It's great... but... after the last update the stupid thing won't even open 80% of the time. When it does it buffers constantly :(,3,06/12/2017,4
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,The app makes loud white noise when opened and the noise starts again after a while. Used to work perfectly before upgrading to nougat. I have a samsung note5 on nougat.,3,06/26/2017,3
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,It could use a new feature _  such as a menu for viewing current downloads and being able to delete said downloads in progress. That being said _  my downloads menu disappeared and can't get it back. Have no idea what happened to it.,4,05/27/2017,10
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Having problems when earphones are plugged in. A lot of static noise before even playing anything.  Other media players are playing just fine.,2,06/19/2017,6

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Once the most essential thing on any device _  it's now fallen through the floor. The addons on the Kodi on my android TV aren't returning any usable results _  and the Kodi on my tablet has stopped working altogether _  just a black screen or a force close.,1,06/12/2017,11
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Ii always liked kodi but the 17.3 krypton update destroyed it. I couldn't search anything  _  watch anything or even do add-ons. Please fix this update kodi used to be great and now it's not.,3,08/04/2017,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Krypton 17.3 is garbage. It seems like they whipped this patch out overnight and feared everyone into updating. Spend more time on 17.4 please.,2,05/29/2017,15
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,What the hell did they do? Ruined my god damn Sheild TV with the newest 1.7 update. Sits there saying "Add on migration in progress" forever. Lately the devs at Kodi have really lost it,1,06/10/2017,15
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Had no clue on how to use it. You have to understand computer software terms _  etc. in order to be able to navigate. How about a help section for those who are new at this type of thing and want to learn?,1,06/16/2017,10
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Authentication error every time I try to install beast build. Im doing all the steps correctly so I'm assuming its the app.,2,06/06/2017,2

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Amazing features and capability.  But the player itself is a piece of garbage. Any disturbance causes the video frame to be lost. Seeking in a stream consistently causes a lockup. This has been more of a pain to use than it is worth. This is for the exceptionally patient.,3,05/29/2017,11
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I have this app on a few devices it's great. Though on my newest device it makes static noises when i open it.... And when i attempt to watch stuff with threa that being said i hope it's fixed ao soon,1,06/22/2017,5

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Okay.... Sorry for the 4.5 ratings buzzkill here: By far one of the darkest _  poorly designed ui's ive ever seen on an app. Fonts too small _  Dark one color mono tone theme _  confusing _  no adequate navigation buttons.... Like uhhh...BACK -FORWARD or HOME buttons. If u can get passed the ui that looks like soviet designed web page on the dark web _  then it should work for u.,2,08/03/2017,2
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,No doubt Kodi is a brilliant media centre platform. However _  for this Android port it honestly needs a design overhaul. The original 10 foot interface is great on TV _  but way too fiddly on a phone _  and even worse _  the Confluence skin doesn't handle touch very well _  I end up with buttons on the interface being highlighted but no amount of tapping gets them to click. OSD buttons and context menus just way too small. And I know I know _  this is all freely available from wonderful volunteers who give up their time. But I also give up mine to test and consider how the product needs changing. Personally _  I only use Kodi on Android for a TVHeadend client. If you're watching local content on a phone _  frankly there are better apps to do it with.,3,08/07/2017,3
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,People need to stop touting this as an app for free movies and tv. Those addons aren't officially supported.   Its a media center for streaming legally owned/subscribed local and ota content.  And it happens to be the best,5,06/14/2017,9
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,was not able to watch anything because no mo ies showed up. i have kodi on my lap top and on my phone but it will not work properly. nothing is showing up when in press movies or add ons.,1,08/06/2017,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Love KODI. You still need to be a bit of a tech-head to to be turned loose on it to get full enjoyment out of it. But it is awesome!! As soon as I get it friendly enough for my wife to use. I'll be dropping Dish.,5,05/25/2017,18
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,U know I was just fine with Kodi 17 but you people have given the new update it crashes each and every time while watching any movie and then I have reinstall it and set it up again but it still crashes plz fix it,1,06/12/2017,6
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Great app. Sooooooo much flux b/c of the battle of free vs. non-legal content that it is always a guess whether it'll work or not next time you go on..,4,08/22/2017,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,The app is squreech static noise. Cannot even open the app. Have to shut down phone to close and stop the noise. Always used to work for me.,1,06/20/2017,3
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Kodi is PRIMO. People that complain need to do there homework. Alot has changed. Addons have gone or moved elsewhere. So go and learn something and make your own build. This is what Kodi is suppose to be about. Make it your own. Thankyou Kodi. You number one.,5,06/24/2017,5
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Unfortunately same basic problems from first day/version of this app:  1. no copy/paste that means for me no way to log in my accounts (youtube _  netflix _  vimeo...) since strong password are imposible to type on Kody keyboard _  also that make impossibility to use api keys;  2. Kodi keyboard is a joke;  3. Outdated media tree hierarchy (the neverending browsing)  :(,1,06/15/2017,12
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Listen!!! kodi is the best _  to me anyways. There's going to be ups and downs _  but trust me when I `say' You guys should already know you came along way. Most ppl don't appreciate it _  but I do. See I don't have to get a Rogers or a Bell cable box or order ppv..... All my sports games are on KODI to watch _  TV shows _  all seasons and episodes. If I feel in the mood to watch 18+ I will without paying a crazy $ _  Forget paying an arm and a leg ordering what you luv to watch _  KODI has made it possible to watch all you're favs for free.  Just for that there really is no way to thank you guys for making this possible _  but i know that I _  and a million other ppl really appreciate what you have done for us and the loads of money you have save ppl I'm a big fan of yours and only wish you need someone else on the team because I've got a lot of great ideas anyways  do what your doing and don't stop or give up there's so much more you can do with KODI,4,06/22/2017,6
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Running Android 7 _  if headphone are in device before launching kodi major static / feedback playing with audio channel changed pitch of sound only.

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I think everyone using third party add-ons should realize they are complaining about stuff that has nothing to do with the app itself and therefore should keep their stupid opinions to themselves. You want to know why your favorite third party add-ons no longer work? It is because you mention them as if they were the intended use for the app then the team at xbmc gets rid of add-ons and repos you talk about because they get into legal troubles. Kodi is NOT an app to "steal" tv with it is a media player if you stopped being morons and getting them into trouble they would be able to focus fully on improving this media player instead of banning repos and creating new builds to make it more difficult for people to pirate things. So if you are using unapproved third party add-ons go cry to someone else because those things have nothing to do with Kodi.,5,08/22/2017,0

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,This v17.2 update is terrible. I can't even open the app after I updated it. The exact same thing happened on my Kodi app on my computer as well when I upgraded to the newest version. What the heck is going in?? At least I can revert back to an older version on my computer. But currently this app is dead space on my phone.,1,05/23/2017,18
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,If your gonna continue to update this app at least make it work better! This app is terribly glitchy now. Stream is a joke now too. Soon to be worthless just like showbox...,2,05/24/2017,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Ok people we need to clarify a few things for Kodi _  most of you think exodus and the other add-ons are apart of kodi... They aren't stop asking them to fix it they aren't responsible for the third party add-ons ask the developer of the add-ons it says who developed it right in the dann detail page of each add-on Kodi is only a media player period. And because it's an open source project they allow other developers to create their own add-ons and add them or add their external server sources for the add-ons because you people keep nagging them to fix these add-ons when they aren't responsible for them by any means they are getting hit with copywright laws and everything so _ it we lose Kodi it's your own damn faults for ruining a media center that has nothing to do with these add-ons to get your free content! Also this new update is a fix from a recent subtitle back that acts as a melodious Trojan with ransomware.,5,05/24/2017,5
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,It's a shame that this is not a stable but beta version. I have different version on my media center so I cannot use my shared mysql database.,5,05/24/2017,9
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,The app has been really lagging since new update. I prefer this app over showbox _   but sadly it's become just like it. This app deserves atleast 4-5 stars. If only that could be fixed.,4,05/23/2017,4
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Used to be fault-free (in the good old days of 16.x) _  but since 17 playback has been terribly jerky at the start. I have to skip forward and back a lot to get it to work,3,05/24/2017,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I like the Krypton version of Kodi. It is smoother and faster than the previous versions. Skin is clean as well. I only use it for Exodus and maybe a couple more add ons _  but the Exodus add on version on the phone is missing content. Which is weird _  because it's perfectly fine on my laptop. This is with the developer of the add on and not Kodi itself _  but just think it is weird. Once again _  great job with the new Kodi layout and all.,4,05/24/2017,32
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Idk if its just me but when I download kodi on my phone install add ons or builds I'll exit then go back on nd everything is gone no addons _  repos _  the build its all gone back to as if I just installed kodi nd also it says I have updates available then I choose to update the addon then it tells me no update available... But it still says UPDATE AVAILABLE!! lol but overall works fine on my laptop just hope they fix the phone version,3,05/23/2017,5
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Most of the bad reviews on here are things that can be fixed with a little user effort. Kodi is not something extremely easy to use but you can watch anything on it. Make sure to install exodus on it.,5,05/23/2017,4
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Brilliant work the Dev team! Those who rate it the app any lower than 5 stars don't understand kodi and the difference between 3rd party addons/builds,5,05/25/2017,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,The links people claim don't work are not controlled or added by kodi team. Can't believe you complain about problems with your illegal activity. People wishing to use version 16.1 _  open settings on your device(not kodi settings). Open "About Phone" and turn of auto updates. Also in backup/restore menu turn off "Auto Restore".,5,10/06/2017,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Love this app! Id use it on my phone if it worked correctly like my firestick does... The app no matter how many time i uninstall and reinstall it always crackles and pops on the sound from the time i open the until i close the app. If there is a way to fix this please let me know! Thanks other than sound it would be 5 stars,1,05/23/2017,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Sound is not supporting through headphone in my Samsung Galaxy Note 5 with android 7.0. Although it was working perfectly in previous android version.,3,05/24/2017,2

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,The biggest issue I have is the keyboard. I wish it used the stock keyboard that comes installed on my phone. I hate that little tiny keyboard they use _  I always misclick letters.,4,05/24/2017,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Loud static when using earphones for android nougat. Worked absolutely perfect on marshmellow,1,05/24/2017,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,17.2 is buggy. Not as smooth as previous versions and when I finish watching an episode and try to get back to the episode list to watch another I get a black screen.  I have to restart the app and go through the site process of finding the right video.,2,05/24/2017,0

You guys composite in everything you can add on in the program _  and it's free to all. Tons of selections of all types of movie's and show selections. You guys have really made this one of the best apps on the market today in pure awesome entertainment. I thank you guys much for all the awesome work you guys have brought to us all. Ty kodi,5,05/21/2017,16
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Excellent app. Installs fast. The only problem I've found so far is that it doesn't work at all. However _  this problem is extremely consistent - every single time I've tried to run it it hasn't worked. This baby don't mess around _  when it doesn't work it just doesn't work at all. Another real good feature is that when you un-install it un-installs _  just like magic. Totally unrecommended - don't get it now _  or ever!,1,05/06/2017,251
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Using Kodi on all my devices. It's great however in the Android app I miss the ability to copy text to input fields. Setting up a webdav server with a 40 random character long password is a dam pain in the ass. Absolutely​ five stars if this is implemented. Or am I just blind?,4,05/10/2017,26
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,i've been using Kodi for quite a while _  started with Gotham then all the succeding versions rolled in. very easy to use app and Youtube is full of resources on how to configure Kodi to your liking. Only problem with Kodi is the junk files and therefore regular maintenance is very much required.,5,04/07/2017,86
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Love it. Works well does everything I want it to do. Don't blame kodi for add on failures. Most work fine. Took me a while to get the hang of now know how to change reinstall and set up from scratch. It's a very versatile app. Krypton harder to set up than Jarvis but persist you will get it in the end.,5,04/04/2017,775
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Can't get dependencies. Means you can't even use youtube. Way to kill an awesome app. Oh and the government suck's for blocking all access to Kodi repositories and there website site. Here we go again another Iraq war but the only difference is its on the internet. Money hungry cable companies can sick a fart out of my ass. Everyone else involved messing it up can get in line. Plenty of farts to go around.,1,04/01/2017,1014
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,My Kodi was working fine up until I did an update to the current version.  I'm having a similar issue that others have posted; it boots _  goes to spash screen _  then closes.  When I try to load it again _  it gets stuck on a black screen and nothing happens.  Will re-review once it works again.,1,04/15/2017,310
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Version 16 worked fine on my Droid phone. Now version 17 is screwed up and dumb. Nothing works and also the tutorial was followed to the letter doesn't work. Version 17 freezes all the time. I can't get version 16 back as the play store won't let me. This app sucks now.,1,05/13/2017,2
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I don't even have regular tv thanks to kodi. Love this app! The exodus plugin is still a little buggy when trying to play from certain sources and doesn't buffer correctly but overall it's the only app I use to watch wherever I want _  from anywhere in the world.,4,03/21/2017,237
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,As many other reviews say _  splash screen then it quits. I hope the interface is not as bad as everybody is saying in the reviews. It would be nice to read some feedback comments from the developers. Then we can see if there are resolutions to all the bad recent reviews.,1,03/30/2017,42
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,The previous version (v6..) worked very well on my tablet _  but this new version is really bad.   You've removed the handy navigation & "back" buttons:  this app runs full-screen _  and it's a real mission to have to swipe away till the Android buttons appear just in order to go back one screen.  Net result: a very unfriendly user interface.  My advice: do NOT update your kodi to this version: rather stick with v6!,1,05/02/2017,13
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Kodi 17 is an disaster in itself. Nothing works. The new skin is contra productive. Third party add-on installation has been intentional hidden. Even a connection to Kodi's own and Official repository doesn't work. Seriously _  if you want to kill an open source project you release something like Kodi 17. It's the worst XBMC/Kodi I have ever tried. And I use xbmc since day one ever since it began in the original Xbox days.,1,03/26/2017,181
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,excellent player and streamer but since updated to 17.1 the file manager section will not allow you to delete or edit files _ even  with the edit file section activated.  it used to work fine on kodi 16.  And this problem is nothing to do with how android 6 works _  as the file manager on the andoid box works fine _   So come on kodi fix it !,4,05/04/2017,5
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I like it. Used to be better. But now scrolling is impossible. Use the scroll bar and it's still on whatever the last highlighted choice is despite showing a different preview in the left pane. Can't just tap to scroll anymore because the interface bounces when you do. Wish it had stayed on Jarvis.,3,04/01/2017,79
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,It was great when it worked. Just recently went to use it for the first time in a while and it wouldn't open completely. It will go to a black screen then crash _   but doesn't even give me the option to send a crash report. I have a nexus 5x.,2,04/14/2017,19
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I've had kodi for a long time. Its all you can ask for. Its got all the movies old and new _  tv shows old and new. NO COMMERCIALS &lt;--- ( awesome ) . yes like anything else _  it gets a little glitchy sometimes _  NO DIFFRENT THAN SATALITE OR CABLE _  it all acts up from time to time. They are always working to improve _  and right on it fixing issues..... It takes some great minds to be able to give this to people. So if you want to stick to what you got _  great _  but I believe I'll stick to kodi _    GREAT JOB EVERYONE,5,10/06/2017,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Does what it is supposed to. Some reviews confuse this with the repos. You  ---- need to do a lot of reg manual maintenance of repos (definitely not for the  ---- lazy nor the obtuse _  so if you are a 'set it and forget it' type _   ---- frustration over all this will own you). Kodi itself is what it is -  ---- brilliant! Recommended.,5,08/21/2018,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,The default skin is terrible however I upgraded from a previous version and it kept the skin I had been using. I presume those moaning about the new look had been using confluence. I think you can switch back to that anyway but use something like titan _   aeon nox or my favourite Xonfluence. 17.1 is an improvement performance wise over 17.0 and upgrading is essential due to security changes meaning some links won't work.,5,04/07/2017,36
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Krypton is a mess. I'm a UI/UX designer and the interface fails to exploit the 50 years of research in that field. Why exactly do you have to make it so darn complex to install add-ons? Have you read the tutorials online? 22 steps _  really?   Anyone up to write a better client? I'll design the interface for free.,2,04/04/2017,42
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,First of all the new 17.1 kodi is bull cap. All it does when I click on the app it shut off as soon as it opens. So I click it again and it just a black screen until it say this app is not working. I have uninstalled and installed it a couple times. It comes on until I add the build I want.,1,04/29/2017,4
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Freezes right after you get it. Search button was utter garbage _  also freezing and crashing when i tapped it. Congrats on getting 12 _ 415 one star ratings But i guess this is what you get for doing stuff like this that doesn't work.,1,04/23/2017,10
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Was very impressed with Kodi running older android tablet and older android phone. Then I was forced to update. Tried to download kodi app from store to tablet _  was told it wouldnt work on device. Tried direct download from kodi _  get a parsing error even though I allowed 3rd party apps. Tried phone next _  was able to download _  but only get a blank screen. Seems like you wouldnt force upgrades on devices that wont run the upgrade _  but it might be a new marketing strategy.,1,04/05/2017,25
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Fantastic idea. Messed up my phone completely though after downloading the add on onto my SD card. My AT&T note 4 had the root counter tripped _  booted into a "custom" safeboot _  lagged horribly and wouldn't connect to the network. After removing my SD card _  phone went back to normal. I'll be removing those Kodi files off the SD. Wish it worked _  because it was awesome!,2,10/03/2018,24
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Ok _  tried for a second time. Even read some tutorials. no _  it's a horrible mess. You spent months making this? Developers _  listen and listen carefully _  this is not user friendly. It's a horrible mess. Only usable as an update where my favorites _  etc are already installed. As a fresh install it's 1 star,2,03/22/2017,111
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,When Kodi krypton was first released it was a little buggy. It seems the issues within the app have been _  or are being worked out. Due to the recent popularity of streaming and  kodi the service as a whole seems to have dropped off. Kodi itself though is a great app made by some dedicated folks.,4,04/01/2017,21
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,11.16.2018: Started it up after a year since my Tab S had a broken screen. And now it had this weird UI _  that is sidebar based and broken. Ugh _  I want my custom UI skin back! 10.31.2016: This has go to be the best network player I've seen. Since upgrading I've noticed it takes longer and longer to shutdown. Hmmm? Wish many of the UI themes weren't so cumbersome. Nearly all have no support for the Note IV _  or any _  pen stylus.,3,11/15/2018,69
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Used to be great before Krypton. Running it on a Samsung tab E. Freezes after a couple of seconds _  I have reinstalled 3 times and it does the same thing every time. I will try it again after next upgrade. Maybe then it will work.,3,05/02/2017,3
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Kodi 17 used to be great but now it takes forever and a day just to freaking load and for specific things I select the providers decrease each time until I have no options. So what is the F****ING point?! When it does play the quality is great _  however the audio sounds like crap! All you hear is a screeching noise. Please update ASAP!!!,1,03/23/2017,20
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,It worked ok at first. And now NOTHING is loading! It keeps coming up stream isn't supported. I have no I deal what's wrong with this but it's about to get deleted!  Pirate Bay alone worked better _  and alot easyer to use.,2,03/29/2017,34
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,What did you do?? This is terrible. Installed ares but can't get the skin to change _  nothing is visible. Ugh I just give up. No point to it all all. Anything but user friendly.  It's a nightmare!,1,03/29/2017,13
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Best App ever.  Have been using it for 15+ years when it was XBMC and android didn't even exist.  Always works so if it doesn't for you _  your doing something wrong.  The dump people that can't figure it out are so dumb that can't use the internet or youtube to figure out how to set it up correctly.,5,05/12/2018,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,This is a good idea _  but the interface is barely useable. I hate opening this each time _  because it crashed often and is very slow. The interface is horrible and half the times that I touch a button _  it doesn't register it _  or it does it super slowly.,3,04/16/2017,3
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Devs plz give me a solution. When a video is playing and i minimise kodi app and go to another app and then come back to kodi _  the video is no more playing and i am back on the links screen. Cant the video stay in a paused position. Is there any setting for that..,1,03/22/2017,33
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Kodi is awesome. Just some of the links or movies are low quality if its a brand new movie out in theaters but overall _  still a great app! I definitely recommend it to all my family and friends.,4,03/31/2017,11
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Have recently updated my Samsung Galaxy S6 to android 7.0. Now when I plug anything in to the headphone jack whilst Kodi is open I get static noise playing full volume. Please fix.,4,05/20/2017,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Latest update made the app unusable.  Trying to start the app for the last 10 minutes and it just hangs.  I have tried different things to get it to work but it simply doesn't,1,04/04/2017,24
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,They blocked a lot of the addons that we all know and love. They made them hard to download and when I logged on to the forum to ask them about it they were rude and nasty towards me and banned my account for bad attitude and rule violation which I didn't know those addons were banned. If you are rude to me expect me to address that issue. Horrible app I used to love it but with all the errors now and the blocked addons I hate it on the phone. It works well on PC and fire stick but the phone version sucks ass.,1,06/15/2017,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,App used to work really well _  now it crashes in start up before getting to the "Kodi" screen. I get a blank screen then it's down. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling and that didn't help either. Please fix developers!,1,03/28/2017,20
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,This app is great _  I love how it works seamlessly. Something that really annoys me is that every other time I try to open the app _  it crashes and doesn't work until I reinstall it. It's become a serious pain _  I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app at least 6 times now and it's getting to be unbearable. Does anyone have a fix for this _  maybe something that could be added in the next update?,3,03/30/2017,13
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Cool.  Any one using this app must use  version 17.1  other versions will not work. Once you download the app you must configure the app. Otherwise it will not work. To configure the app go to the official kodi app at kodi.TV there you will learn to how to configure kodi.lots if steps but not hard to do. You tube how to configure kodi as well. There you will get step by step how to download and configure kodi. Best of luck,4,04/18/2017,9
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Was 5 Stars...before i updated to android 7.0...now it makes a loud noise when i open the app and it never goes off _  forces us to shut it down. NEED AN UPDATE FOR 7.O Compatibility,1,04/25/2017,5
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,The update to version 17 crashed my Honor Note 8 but that seems to have been fixed with a recent update. A wonderful piece of media software that brings features from many different apps and brings them all into one place.,1,03/22/2017,23
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Please fix the loud static when you open app. Its really painful if you have headphones in your ear. Once fixed its 5 star,1,05/16/2017,3
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,It makes a horrible noise thru my speaker. No matter how many times uninstall. Then reinstall at alater date. Need to fix asap. I enjoyed kodiv16 way better. There wasn't thia headache can't view a thing!,2,03/23/2017,16
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Awesome Love the app does everything I want it to do. Cable companies need to realize times are changing cable is pointless and expensive to watch a whole lot of nothing you dont want to watch and have to wait all day to watch what you do want to watch. Totally lame. I am so sick of cable. I got rid of cable way before I found kodi but now I love the ease of just watching what I want when I want no Bulls hit from the cable companies. Cable companies need to just back off. Greedy bastards. I think they have been slowly sucking our blood like parasites for far to long.,5,04/22/2017,2
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Can't figure out how to watch tv shows or movies on my phone with this. I have Amazon fire stick and use kodi and exodus on my tv but don't know how to use kodi on my phone for anything. Please someone help me to set this up on my phone !!,2,03/25/2017,20
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I don't know what people are complaining about. It's the best open source media player and it's free. Why do people moan about free software? I will never understand that.,5,10/24/2017,6
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,would give 5 stars but since new update in March every time I try and watch something with my headphones a very loud static noise happens. hurts my ears every time. now I don't chance using this app. please fix so I can start using it again. I loved this app hope you fix it soon!,3,05/12/2017,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,The app itself is great. However _  if you stop using it for more than 24 hours it does not work anymore on Android period is this only me? Or is it happening to more people? I have not use the up since Wednesday and it is now Friday and _  the APA stopped working I have to go to app store and every time I check and I look to see if it needs an update and it never needs an update it's only needed a couple of days and I've had it for 2 weeks cuz it's happened also two weeks ago but _  then I have to uninstall the app and then try to reinstall it it takes more storage the second time. It's kind of annoying is this only happening to me?,4,05/12/2017,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,What a load of rubbish this updated version is!!! I've been using kodi on. Y android phone for years now and this update actually makes me sick of this app. Even if I download the 16.1 jarvis version from apk which is the best version out it automatically updates to the latest crap.!!! So frustrating,1,04/26/2017,3
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,New update is garbage. Was a fantastic app but the new version won't open my addons _  open settings _  use toggle switches or generally work at all. Infuriating.,1,04/13/2017,6
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Kodi 17.0 crash where can I find Kodi 16.1 that works fine on my phone.Got Kodi 16.1 off the web site now working perfectly again. UPDATE 17.1 Also crashes my phone so this app is useless until this problem has been fix rollback to 16.1 that works perfectly,1,03/23/2017,16
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,New version's buttons don't work. If you accidentally hit return _  there's no way to return to what you were doing because the touch inputs are all misaligned. Old version was better with no way to go back to it. Used to be great _  now it's unusable.,1,03/27/2017,8
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Latest update killed my existing install _  addons _  and settings. Pain to have to set it all up again. Better testing please.  In general it's been a decent app though _  last ui update made it a bit harder to use on phones.,2,03/21/2017,18
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Everyone is complaining about the kodi 17 interface/skin. Brah _  dont complain and act like a noob...just download and install confluence again if you're too lazy 2 learn the new interface....geez!,5,04/01/2017,10

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,This is one of my most favorite apps _  other than the few odd glitches every app has _  it's great. I would say the best thing about this app that I only use it for to be honest is Exodus 😂. One of the things I hate though is that it has a feature where you can resume watching something but it's glitchy and sometimes work _  but it does work if you pause it _  then stop it. Great app guys.,5,04/17/2017,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,it was a 5 stars app before the upgrade. now the sound is out of sync. sometimes weird behaviour. i use now the media centre from my zidoo box.,2,03/30/2017,3
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Terrible app. Can't even get it to open _  it crashes every time. Waste of time and storage downloading this app. My recommendation is to pass on this crap,1,04/27/2017,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,What happened?! Every time I attempt to open the app it black screens or immediately closes out. Forced update and all... bummer because prior to the update the app worked really well. Idk what your development team is doing but kodi is absolute garbage now. Uninstall. Hopefully you fix this issue.,1,05/02/2017,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,App was working great up until a few days ago. Now it doesn't let me in. Its just a black screen when I open it up. Will rate it 5 stars when its back up.,1,04/18/2017,2

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,This app sucks. HUGE disappointment. Kodi works great on all my Amazon sticks but this app and the add ons are frustrating. Just to get it to do what it does perfectly fine on my Amazon sticks is a nightmare. I highly recommend if u want to smash your phone off the pavement,1,07/20/2017,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I think this is an great app but after i updated it before the recent update ive been unable to get back into app.  Any idea why that's happening? I'm just stuck at waiting for external storage page.,3,03/21/2017,16
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Unfortunately _  you can download to an android blackberry phone and install it _  but no links work _   making it useless if you want a blackberry. Otherwise _  love the access to all my shows _  saves me a fortune.,5,04/25/2017,1

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Amazing I think it just needs an update or something. Used to be able to stream stuff all the time with 0 problems and now the screen is always flashing green and stuff. It's definitely worth 5 stars tho,4,05/22/2017,0

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,To any of you who are blaming the Kodi for any faults you have _  take a look at what blatantly obvious add-on you're trying to install and actually learn how to use Kodi / media players in general before you move on to that... Kodi works wonderfully as an all purpose media player for Android and the add-ons are just an added benefit to it... If you can't get dependencies _  update your android version _  update Kodi _  find another functional media player or work with what you've got (it's really not hard to fix it or find more); if your add-ons aren't working like you want them to _  again _  update Android / Kodi or in app update the add-on... I have yet to find an actual noteworthy fault with Kodi itself and I give big props to XBMC Foundation for actually providing something worth downloading (especially for it being free)...,5,05/21/2017,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I have kids on a few devices and it's great I can't fault it. I would say it's a bit pointless on smaller screen devices though,5,04/10/2017,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,So slow and works like crap compare to the previous version.  Movies on my Windows share that were working perfectly with Kodi 16 are now out of sync in version 17.  Same for my music.  It constantly skips.,2,04/21/2017,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I love it _  best decision ever. The setup up is tedious however but definitely worth it. I didn't have to get the firestick  was  able to use my Samsung tablet.,5,04/20/2017,2

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Great app but remember people _  Kodi is only the platform. If an addon doesn't work _  it's nothing to do with them _  it's the addon's developers you need to get on to. If you want a great build _  try The Mammoth Build from Wookie's wizard.,5,04/12/2017,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Don't update and it's great. Read reviews before updating. Mine works fine _  because I didn't update it.😃Always read reviews before a new update on ANYTHING. There is your best Android app tip ever.,5,06/25/2017,0

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Impossible to scroll. This app makes it impossible to scroll up or down using finger up/down swipe. It's like it had a minds of its own. Whenever you swipe up or down on a list of videos it will either go in the opposite direction or touch/play a video that is 6 videos down from where you swiped. Very frustrating.,1,04/21/2017,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,The UI is very unresponsive. Lagging UI. Not useable UI. Although it is very feature rich. Would love to use this app once it's UI fixes are completed. Also it should improve it's video player for more controls like the mx player,1,05/20/2017,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Everything on the new Krypton version downloaded fine _  had no issues at all with anything but every other time I open the app it makes a permanent static noise on my phone until I close and reopen it.

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Initially when it changed from jarvis i was very displeased with it. Now with the 17.1 krypton _  i felt like i originally did with xmbc. Great job!,5,03/21/2017,16
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Love love LOVE this app! Yes it's a little bit buggy and it needs a more user friendly interface but with the right add-ons you get 100% free TV. Any show you want And there are no commercials.,5,04/23/2017,2
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,A lot of videos don't work _  or want you to go to another site. App itself is super slow _  casting would be a big plus as well.,3,03/27/2017,3

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Needs to support copy paste. Such an incredibly basic feature but is unsupported. Need to enter an m3u address? Write it down because tabbing out and back in deletes everything.,2,04/24/2017,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,It su× ! I installed this version because there are no sources with jarvis to watch anything and this build crashes before it even loads.

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Movies on the go! Same app I use at home for our firestick. Works great. Always updated soon after your favorite TV shows air on TV. Easy to use and unlimited access to all networks/channels that you'd normally be required to pay for in addition to already paying for cable. Highly recommend!

Then open your Kodi app and follow the online instructions to install in within the Kodi app and enjoy your free movies/shows!,5,04/01/2017,1

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Kodi 17 (Krypton) should NEVER have been released in its current form. It is basically unusable on Android. There are just too many bugs too list.  Save yourself hours of frustration and stick to Kodi 16 until this "update" has been fixed.,1,04/15/2017,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,The latest version _  Krapton no longer supports addons like Exodus that worked great on Jarvis... stay away from latest version as its crapware.,1,04/30/2017,1

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Aside from the menu being wonky af _  thinking I'm clicking something under what I'm actually clicking _  it's an amazing app. Though with androids latest update for galaxy s6 _  released just days ago _  there's an audio compatibility issue that causes awful static through headphones/earbuds for a few seconds after opening the app with them in _  plugging them in while the app is open _  and after each episode or movie if I don't stop the file and close it myself. I tested the earbuds on other apps and devices and they work fine on the others. Hopefully one of you guys reads this so you can figure out a fix for this soon _  if it's not something Samsung needs to fix with a firmware patch. It's not a big deal or anything _  it doesn't make the app unusable. Anyway _  I have to thank you guys for making this app _  and choosing not to include ads _  not a lot of devs do that _  so it makes it that much more special that you guys decided to put users before profit _  in terms of advertising in the app. Good on you guys. :) To be honest _  I'd pay for this app if you charged for it. :),4,04/24/2017,0

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,OK. Whoever the designers are off this app either just develop to develop and don't use this app _  or they develop this app _  use it _  and think it's OK. Wrong.  Problem 1 - Media control buttons: Who decided to design a button the size of a breadcrumb? Trying to press play or stop is a nightmare. When trying to press a breadcrumb sized button _  instead of having what I press register as a command _  Kodi attempts to apply my input to either if the icons next to what I'm pressing. I have a nexus 6p and the buttons are way too small. Imagine people on devices with smaller screens. They won't be able to control their media Problem 2 - Scrolling: Another terrible design when selecting media or other files. Instead of being able to scroll notch by notch(or file by file) _  devs decided to free scroll. Bad idea. Why? Because everything in relation to a device is TOO SMALL. Try selecting a file. It's near impossible selecting a file without Kodi thinking that when removing my finger from the screen _  I want to scroll up or down.  Problem 3 - Keyboard: Probably the worst thing about Kodi. Some stupid devs decided that you can't use your device's keyboard when searching and making the Kodi keyboard mandatory. Which again _  keys are too small and the keyboard doesn't scale with your device.  Jesus christ devs _  these are design 101 aspects.  Myself nor anyone else should be annoyed when attempting to use simple control functions of an app. If I can't use it easily _  then what makes you think you can?,1,04/07/2017,0

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Love the new update! Yes the settings have changed but that is because there has been a lot of work under the hood. A lot of people because they don't know or can't be bothered to work out out how to set things up correctly and it's so easy to just give a negative review. Give it time and you will see its all for the better!!,5,02/05/2017,846
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I absolutely love this app. It's definitely a wonderful way to get everything u need. Since the most recent update I can no longer open my app at all. It will pop up black and then disappear and when I try to open it again it just pops up with a black screen and does nothing. For the love of God please fix it!!! This is legit my all time favorite app on my phone. Please please please fix and I'll change my rating to 5 stars.,1,02/26/2017,337
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,It doesn't work when you upgrade your phone to 7.0 with the Moto z force. I know a couple other people said it too _  but I am hoping that if more people say it _  the quicker and more likely it will get fixed   Edit: thank you so so much for updating and fixing it! I missed my Kodi!!,1,02/09/2017,176
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,You'll have 2go watch a YouTube video of easiest one touch programming to get the most out of this app but it's well worth the 15 minutes of time that it will take to setup properly & I'm hard2 impress & I gave it a 5 star so if u don't give 5 stars u don't like 2watch free movies & live & previously played TV _  or u don't give it 2any app anytime _  best app I've ever downloaded from any place by far! If u have any problems with programming it _  go 2 YouTube & it'll have several different set ups for u 2 try out. It doesn't play movies & tv stuff without being programmed but all the stuff on utube  is free so please don't let this app pass u by.,5,02/12/2017,66
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Best software period. Its bogus that Kodi gets the unwanted attention  by people who take advantage and exploite it because its free with the ability to download 3rd party apps _  by the way which Kodi has no connection to _  Kodi is a media player thats it. they get blamed for thees apps that people download and when they dont work properly they catch heat because people don't understand that Kodi has nothing to do with the apps you've installed. We need to protect Kodi so we can continue to enjoy its wonderful benefits.,5,03/02/2017,28
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Not sure why everyone is complaining. The app works perfectly and the new style looks fantastic. I used the beta with zero problems as well. Since this is a new release _  sources are still pushing out updates for the new design.  Everyone that can't find their add-ons _  try going to the add-on section under radio. 😐,5,02/05/2017,211
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,i gave 5 stars for v16. 3 stars for v17 because several bugs needs to be fixed one of them it freezes when watching an HD movie _  i have to wait 1 minute and then it goes back to the list to reopen the movie and it repeates several times,3,03/12/2017,9
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Great _  but the tracking stinks since the latest update. No FFW or REW buttons anymore _  but the tracking bar really doesn't work at all on my phone (okay on laptop). It is very frustrating. Please bring back the tracking buttons! Or at least 10 sec skip forward and back buttons.,3,03/11/2017,10
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Since updating to Android 7.0 Nougat Kodi will not function properly.  Certain buttons do not respond any more. Cannot uninstall an add-on now. Long pressing an item won't pop up the info menu anymore. Cant add any repositories now. Please update Kodi for Nougat so it works right. Using S7 Edge.,2,02/27/2017,8
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I have Kodi on my Firestick _  and it works pretty well there. On my S6 _  however _  Kodi has been trash as of late. I like Futurama _  and I can find plenty of episodes _  but all I get are messages telling me "no stream available." If there are no streams available _  fine _  but why post links to episodes that I cannot watch? Trash.,3,02/23/2017,16
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,It seems good and easy to use and I would give it more stars but i can't get any movies to work.  Plenty to choose from but none of them open up for me.  It just says i need to click on the link to pair my device with the movie but the link doesn't work... help?,2,03/15/2017,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I changed back to confluence skin. It's an easier interface to work with. This new Krypton skin looks good and all but the settings _  the menu _  the options _  aren't properly placed. Some don't make sense at all. Maybe re-arrange some of the buttons to make more sense. And add a back button.,5,03/10/2017,6
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,To those complaining about the update. You do know you can simply change the skin back to the default kodi 16.1 skin right? Go to interface under the settings and click skins. Then go to "get more" and scroll down until you see the skin called confluence (default old kodi skin) and then install it. There you go _  it's identical to kodi 16.1 but with all the under the hood improvements from 17.0. You're welcome.,5,02/05/2017,105
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I prefer the old version SO much more _  this one is harder to use and I can't find all the things I was able to before. I just want to know how to get back the old version _  if I can that is. Also I don't need to know what you updated EVERY time I get on _  especially when it repeats the same things constantly 😧 over and over again.,3,03/12/2017,5
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Absolutely the best _  thanku Google for providing this and the devs for the hard work _  in terms of the latest Krypton version. Will get some getting used to _  hard to navigate _  no back button. Screens are abit confusing as you don't know what screen your at. Jarvis was alot better at this _  but hopefully it will improve with time. Onwards and upwards so 3 for now. Good first update. The touch feature is way off sometimes. Randomly clicks something else.,5,02/07/2017,47
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I see a lot of people saying the new update is great _  but I can't get on with it at all? The menu has changed _  which is OK _  but will take time to get used to _  but the biggest problem for me is that trying to scroll through the menu's _  it often selects the item I don't want as it is far too sensitive!  Also _  a chromecast icon wouldn't go a miss.  It's a 2 from me I'm afraid as the old Kodi worked just fine.,2,02/06/2017,101
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,The most stupid piece of bullshit anyone can download on their Android phone or computer. I have spent 20 minutes trying to download something called Exodus but no one tells me where to get the zip file from. I'm sticking with Mobdro!!!!,1,02/25/2017,2
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Well I've been using kodi for years _  and a lot of people are pissed off and I'm one of them. It's not that I don't know how to use it _  it's that it does not work. I add the source for fusion and it doesn't give me anything in the begin here but some dumb indigo app. Don't fix something that isn't broke. These changes are terrible.,1,02/05/2017,63
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I m finding difficulty using this new kodi.. I just hate this 1. Why do you keep changing things all the time and make things so complicated... I love the old Kodi,1,02/17/2017,22
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,17.1 sucks! Extremely unstable and force closes constantly. I uninstalled and reinstalled my 16.1 apk. 17.1 interface is also extremely confusing.  You can't lock add-ons in place or customize your interface like you can in 16.1... DON'T RECOMMEND UPDATING! I hope kodi developers make 18.1 customizable again like 16.1,1,05/03/2017,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,The krypton update broke access to the Kodi repository. Everything already there still works but I can't install new add-ons or update existing ones. I do like the new skin.,2,02/19/2017,7
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Have used kodi since the xbmc days and never had an auto update forced on me! I would have no issue with the new layout(touch sensitivity seemed to be off tbh)but I have audio skipping probs on my android device now with Krypton which makes watching anything impossible and is not fixable with the audio settings in kodi! Downloaded a Jarvis 16.1 stable apk and got back to a smooth running kodi _ only for it to balls up completely again when I turned my device off/on again!!!,1,02/11/2017,23
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I think its wrong to force an update on users when the app itself declares that it is an unstable version. How can developers do something so stupid.  There's not even a roll back option.,1,02/07/2017,43
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Still a little buggy on android tv but I'm confident that the awesome people who developed this app will work out the kinks. Runs like a dream on Windoze and that's no small feat! Keep up the great work folks I for one appreciate all the hard work. Cheers!,3,02/05/2017,27
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I've had this on my phone for a year now and it worked really well at first. After a while it stopped playing videos after watching one. It's really annoying. The issue isn't my phone not my connection _  it's the app. Love the fact I can find everything I want to watch on it... When it allows me too...,3,02/13/2017,7
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Latest up date had really streamlined the app _  works _ better now. Cant see why some peeps not happy with it. If your having problems its ya internet supplyer thats messing with it. Go to kodi forums and find out what settings you need to change _  for example I had to log in to virgin media and disable an option. Your isp's are gonna be messing with it this year because of a court verdict.,5,02/07/2017,9
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,The new update is literally and completely unusable. I can not select anything _  where I push is not where kodi registers I am pushing. Did you guys test this? At all? Even open it.... Cause you broke it! How can I roll back to the previous version that actually works? Galaxy s7 edge stock,4,02/09/2017,27
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,This is by far my favorite app ever. Only problem now ia i cant watch what i want. When I go to select the show it scrolls on its own and picks at random. Its doing the same thing on my Tablet as my phone,2,02/07/2017,24
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,It worked great on my phone until you updated it. Now I can't even figure out how to get it to work. It takes forever to find anything on the new update. I finally got to the pulse build page and nothing work from there. Once I got it to say kodi needs to shut down and reopen _  but then it said my kodi wasn't updated. It's extremely annoying. It was working so good before the update.,5,02/12/2017,17
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Since the upgrade _  watching movies or even searching for movies have become a thing of the past. Maybe it was due to copyright laws or a change in Tech staff _  but someone really screwed up this once wonderful App and I suggest the makers revert back to the older more lovable version.,1,03/16/2017,2
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Why make such  a ridiculously complicated app? In trying to do everything the result is that only a coder or mega geek can understand how to use it. Maybe that's the point. Seems a shame to limit it's huge potential when it just needs a GUI that someone with normal tech knowledge can operate. :o/,1,02/09/2017,9
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,V16 was great but V17 seems unfinished both on Android and PC. The default skin is missing functionality. Can't even fast forward videos. Back buttons are missing on some setting pages. TV does not show preview of the channel _  it shows on background but it is not possible to see anything. Estouchy works so much better but still it has problems. Overall _  it seems the v17 app was released too early!,2,02/17/2017,8
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Absolutely hands down a 5 star app before this update. Now I'm even hesitant to give it a 1 star. There was nothing wrong with the previous version. Was highly recommending Kodi to everyone before the update. Why fix something that isn't/wasn't  broke?!,1,02/05/2017,58
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Great app for movies. But the new krypton update is garbage that was forced onto mobile users. I changed the skin to the old style _  but doesnt fix the issue where i continually get kicked from the movie.,2,02/07/2017,35
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Krypton is very slow at loading. It takes 5 minutes to load all the tv shows _  and then when I pick the tv show it takes another 5 minutes and doesn't even load up the seasons of the show. I loved this app during version 16.0 _  but now it barely works. Please help me fix it or at least let me go back to an older version.,1,02/25/2017,4
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Needs work. Updated on the Shield TV.  After the update it is slow to load anything. Will spend many minutes watching the spinning circle unable to go back to previous list. Reinstalled with same issue.,3,02/14/2017,5
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Touch screen controls not accurate after kyrpton update _  selects items that were not pressed _  playback controls don't work at all _  couldn't stop a video from playing and also couldn't exit app _  had to force stop it. The one thing it should absolutely have _  Chromecast integration _  is missing _  so the cast screen option has to be used _  screen has to be on the whole time _  and my phone can't be used for anything else while watching.,3,02/09/2017,4
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Touch screen calibration is horrible. Popular addons are still catching up. Alota dependencies either failed or links failed to play. Stick with Jarvis @the moment ..it is still strong and kicking.,2,02/09/2017,13
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Unable to get this program to work. No way of asking for help. Nothing comes up just the side list. Once you select it screen goes blank.,1,03/19/2017,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Love the new interface!! 2/7/2017  I really only use Exodus but this app has already saved my family many many dollars. Disconnected cable and Netflix and I just screen share my phone to my TV to watch everything.,5,02/07/2017,5
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Krypton is the worst. It feels like they tried to simplify a great program _  and screwed it up. Also _  it makes custom builds stop working _  gonna have to go reinstall mine _  this freaking sucks.,1,02/06/2017,20
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Like the idea of Kodi......... But Major buffering. Sometimes addons fail to work. Links say HD and they're 480 at a push. So much easier to find working links for whatever you wanna watch via google,3,03/20/2017,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I have no idea how to install anything in the new update. How do you install repositories etc. I can't find where to install from zip files etc  The new kodi is impossible to navigate,1,03/11/2017,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,The ateps on website a bit vague. But managed to get it runni g. Android kicking ipho es butt on this one. Thanks kodi,5,02/11/2017,2
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Awesome app with great user interface. I can play stuff on the device or on a network share.  I do wish it had built in syncing. Don't  ruin it's reputation by installing plug-ins that are illegal!!!!  If you do _  YOU are the bad guy!!!!,5,03/04/2017,11
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,App Is to hard go back on _  or last page...  like the graphic lay out is complicated _   needs open up where left OFF. Using LgG5 Like all movies it's NAVIGATION OF THE APP.😞😡  Skins have updated _   but still searching. For exodus.. Like... Icon should just pop up.,3,02/16/2017,5
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,No tracking bar? And it's so slow!  10-15 seconds for response after clicking. Nougat android. Jarvis worked perfectly. Looks really nice but unfortunately unusable at moment. Is this going to be fixed? Or shall I revert to Jarvis?,2,03/13/2017,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Fantastic piece of software. The new update! Yeah most people will be confused as some of there.....programs won't work for now. No doubt u will get used to it. Well done kodi,5,02/06/2017,7
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Love the crappy reviews saying "My TV shows and Movies don't work". Stop watching pirated content! There _  problem solved. (And if it's your legally owned content that doesn't work correctly _  go to their website/forum and they will be glad to help you get it going),5,02/06/2017,7
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Not nature enough to be released as a major version. Complicated to use _  impossible to navigate _  crashes all the time _  frequent loss of responsiveness... you took something simple and stable and made something worse!,2,03/07/2017,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I like how smoothly it works and closes when you don't need it anymore. I wasn't impressed to find all my addons that I took all the time to configure in the previous version had disappeared when the update took place.,4,02/24/2017,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I hate this layout.. Way too hard to navigate around... If its not broke don't fix it there was nothing wrong with the way it was,2,02/11/2017,5
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Upset with new update? Just use "confluence" skin _  and it will look like the old version _  but still containing all the new improvements,5,02/12/2017,3
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,This latest update won't allow me to install the TopTutorials Hyper TT build _  which was the only reason I even used this app. I used to think it was great but thanks to 17 Krypton it's now useless garbage. Thank you for ruining this for me.,1,02/26/2017,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Krypton seems to be OK except sometimes I get booted out of TV shows. I'm sure it will be fixed. I love the new upgrade. I installed the spinzrepo and it's even more user friendly now.,5,02/06/2017,6
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Why have they changed a brilliant version jarvis to this awful new one it is much worse. And I can't go back to the old version as it updated automatically.,2,02/07/2017,7
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Won't work any more. I just have the complete kodi set up on my screen and then nothing Was working perfectly,1,02/06/2017,14
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Krypton broke it.   Now unable to connect to SMB server to play my files over network. Works fine with PC version on exactly the same settings.,1,02/05/2017,17
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Amazing! This is the Best working media player out there! There is horrible stuff like Popcorn Time But I jailbroken this and It is so easy! Definitely get it if you want free movies and TV shows!,5,03/18/2017,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,It worked so perfectly before this update. Now it crashes every time I try to open it. And when I do finally get it to open when I click on things instead of loading to it it shows a dark blue screen,1,02/09/2017,9
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Change it back to Jarvis. The text and touch zones were minuscule but they worked. The touch functionally in Krypton is terrible. Scroll menus jump around so incorrect selection is almost always made.,1,02/25/2017,3
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,The new version doesn't work at all and every provider needs to be paired to a different website. It is terrible.,1,03/01/2017,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Crap.  How is it possible to have rating as high as it has when there are so many 1 star ratings?  I think maybe fake ratings involved.,1,02/15/2017,4
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Kodi updated But there seems to be issues with  It as there many things on it that don't seem to work  Please fix  Can't install any builds Besides the version 17 kodi supported,1,02/19/2017,6
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,i would like it alot more if i could use my phones video player so i can stream it to my xbox but i cant _  other than that its a decent app,4,02/05/2017,20
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,You make huge mistake first of all the application looking beauty but you can't even click it and it jumps when ever I try to click a link if I knew I shouldn't upgrade it ..  is so confusing,2,02/06/2017,9
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I love the new layout. Great app. Have it on all my devices. Only ever had a few problems but that's prob my Wi-Fi lol,5,02/06/2017,3
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,App worked great until I updated my Galaxy S7 to Nougat. Now when I try to open Kodi all I get is a black screen. Hopefully this is fixed soon,2,03/12/2017,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Kodi 16 great.  Kodi 17 is terrible.  The touchscreen is not calibrated and you never get what you press on.  Truly awful update 😥,1,02/19/2017,2
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Most of my 1080p videos that worked with the previous version now run horribly. The new skin isn't great to use but I could get used to it if the app functioned as well as before.,2,02/10/2017,3

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,This works well if you install the right build _  most of Kodi 16.1 Jarvis builds are not compatible with this version of Kodi.  So be warned you will loose all your settings/ addons/ skins etc. _  if you upgrade.  Its not the developers fault as Kodi is not supposed to be use with third party addons!.  If you still want to give this version a try _  just search on Youtube best builds for Kodi 17 _  you should be up and running in no time.,5,02/02/2017,104
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I like the new setup. But I am having problems with the app on my Samsung Galaxy tab S. When I first start the app an an opting sound comes through my speakers. Kind of like static. It also does when clicking through links. Did not do this while using Jarvis. Also one of my favorite links stopped working due to the update. Will change to 5 stars once app is updated. Keep up the good work.,3,02/22/2017,3
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,KODI is the most powerful _  and the best multi media software hands down. Everyone giving it a bad review just doesn't know how to set it up... KODI has configured my entire Media library with thumbnail pic's and info in an easy to use interface... It turn my old retired PC into an amazing HTPC...,5,02/04/2017,59
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Estuary brings the relevant to the front _  similar to the fire TV experience. Learn the settings and you will build and streamline your set up to your liking. Estuary will almost tell you which extra's you don't use. Letting you simplify more for ease of use. Delete the stuff you don't use _  keep it simple _  and read/watch with a simple search if you are unsure. Failing that find a build to quantify your failure to learn. +5 year user of the software _  and several months of estuary use in libreelec _  no ariel or other set top box needed ;) 1st class work as always _  Thanks :D,5,02/02/2017,51
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Why all the fuss folks? The reason you are having problems is you need to change the screen to the touch interface.  Changing the configuration to the system you are using further increases the functionality  (i.e. Android for Android driven tablets).  I like the new layouts _  can see a l9t more on the screen when selecting shows.,5,02/04/2017,5
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,After update app no longer runs on Chromebook. Kodi used to run fine as an Android app on Acer R11 Chromebook with Play Store. Now after the most recent update it immediately crashes upon launch. I love the app 2 days ago but now cant use it at all. This doesnt seem like too much of a stretch considering that all Chromebooks moving forward will have access to the Google Play Store.,5,02/25/2017,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,This app is so cool all the movies are new even the new episodes of any season are great I love this app. But maybe the new update it has some problems cause it starting to take to long . I hope it is fixed. I even told everyone I know or get to know about this app and to download this and give it a big golden star just like I did.,5,03/05/2017,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,From 5 to 1. This is the worst skin I have ever seen. Why change the default skin to something that isn't even user friendly? The old default skin is easy to use and most of us change the skin anyway. Addons have stopped working although that's up to the add-on devs to fix not you guys. Overall disappointed with kodi. The guy saying settings are missing _  they are not missing they have just completely changed it to confuse us. I had this problem on laptop and knew this was coming.,1,02/02/2017,81
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Still a quality app I'm on a HTC 10 running latest Android software and I have no problems with this app. For those with issues try emailing them before having a pop on here about it. Oh yeah nearly forgot please could you add a chromecast feature please please please! 😂,5,02/02/2017,6
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Why fix something that wasn't broken _  worsed Kodi skin ever _  why would you mess it up so badly. Sack the idiot who came up with this. Thankfully I have changed it back to the old style in the settings but now have to reinstall No Limits again.,2,02/02/2017,39
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I loved this app and was wholeheartedly recommending it to everyone. It was working perfectly but it's ruined now. Idk what's up with this update but the layout isnt very user friendly. It's very jumpy. Loading times are horrible. Idk the whole thing is horrible please put it back to the original layout I hate it. Now it won't even load without me restarting my phone. I hate this app.,1,03/15/2017,12
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,This update sucks! When are you going to update this useless version? Can't open anything because adons jump all over the screen. Fix this now become useless app plz. Garbage and skin sucks. Why change a working system? Fire those donkeys who put the current version together. Samsung S5,1,03/05/2017,29
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,The new kodi is way too complicated. In the last version you pretty much searched up a title _  found a compatable url _  and watched. With the update I can't find titles of any kind much less watch or listen to them. Just too confusing _  this new kodi needs way more work done to it. As of now I'm no longer using this app. Google,1,03/27/2017,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,This update rocks!! All the under the hood improvements are noticed right from the get go. As always kodi devs seem to always impress on each update! All the negativity over the default skin is sillyness _  if you don't like the skin _  than change it back to confluence _  that easy. I'm starting to like the new skin _  and maybe with future updates for it _  to allow some more tweaking it may be a really strong contender! Love the work devs _  keep up the great work!!!,5,02/05/2017,3
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I noticed that some addons disable  themselves automatically _  you need to go to my addons and re-enable them.  I lose my shortcuts everytime I close Kodi. I think we need a save button on the page that is used to create shortcuts. It needs work _  and I need to adjust to the change. It also crashes occasionally. I'm sure many of the bugs will be addressed soon.,4,02/03/2017,38
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I loved the Jarvis version. It was so user friendly. But Krypton is horrible. No matter what I do if I click something it suddenly Jo's the page to something completely different. It takes forever to load anything. It was such a good app before. Please fix. For now I'm deleting this app. Hopefully you will fix it soon.,1,02/02/2017,24
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,This use to be a nice app.. I haven't completed the upgrade because there was nothing wrong with the old one _  however my friends that have contact me and I tell sorry but you can't access the old one and not to many people know how to make the new p.o.s. work.. I love looking at the generic responses and also the team members trying to bring their ratings back up with just thumb ups..ha ha ha,1,02/08/2017,3
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,App auto updated _  and now my addons don't work. It's also extra slow with the new update. Usually a great app _  but it only gets 1 star until they can fix the bugs and make the app useable again.,1,02/04/2017,11
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,It's just not opening certain files. It just keeps saying failing or something...annoyed. I love using it but man I can't finish my show Kingdom because it won't open certain episodes.Update: Update sucks. Messed everything up. I can't watch anything.,1,02/04/2017,6
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Its a good app now i used youtube to actually fugure out how to work it. But is there any chance you guys could add a button that allows you to cast video thats playing to a device like an xbox or smart tv? Cuz its kinda sucky having to watch stuff on my phone,4,02/19/2017,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I don't mind how the new version of it looks.. But it's completely hard to tap on titles and stuff like that.. You tap on a movie and it'll scroll down selecting another movie.. I was going crazy _  please fix this. Other than that.. Wonderful ! ☺,5,02/06/2017,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Give the new update a chance.  Go on YouTube or Google for using version 17.  All of your legal and illegal add-ons will still work _  once reinstalled for this version.  If you hate change _  as many commenters seem to _  you can even download _  and change the skin back to the old default one.  I have been using the pre-builds for months on my laptops _  I did not like it at first but change is necessary _  for most things _  unless it becomes obsolete like Kodack cameras _  VHS tapes _  or payphone booths. 😀,5,02/04/2017,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Liking the current krypton touch user interface... but I'm missing the "visualizations" during audio playback? was it just put somewhere else in the settings? How can I download the bouncing 3d equalizer? I kinda miss that... thanks! UPDATE: oh it was there all along Just had to enable it in the add on settings... THANKS LOVING THE NEW KODI! More power to the amazing DEVS! KODI FOREVER!!!! :-),5,02/03/2017,7
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,It really is a great media  Player with functionality no other media player can probably match... But it tends to hang at times for no reason at all.. Probably a glitch in the installation I did on my phone.. Never the less it's still amzing !,5,03/12/2017,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Ok heres the quick solution to the they f@#$ed up Kodi with the update. Head to the setting menu (the thing that looks like a gear) _  select Interface settings _  select skin _  over in the righthand menu slect skin (the default is Estuary right now) select get more _  scroll down to Confluence (the skins are in alphabetical order) slect Confluence let it load & your back in business with the old look. Your library should still be there.,5,02/12/2017,4
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,A week ago _  I had access (via Exodus) to Netflix _  Showtime _  HBO _  etc. _  but now all of that disappeared. I used to have a category​ where all this was but it went away. Gladly give u ten stars if u can help me get it all back. Thanks,2,03/18/2017,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,No problems _  addons installation as easy as usual. Didn't like the default skin much but it is really easy to change it back to the confluence skin. Don't no why so many negative feedbacks? If you don't like the new interface change it!,4,02/02/2017,13
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Kodi 16 worked great but Kodi 17 not so great on my Android 6 operating system.It constantly shuts down for no reason. Also responses are very slow compared to Kodi 16. Think Kodi 17 needs more work. If you are thinking of switching from Kodi 16 to Kodi 17 think twice before doing so at this time.,1,03/03/2017,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Update? I don't know what you guys did _  but half the functions aren't working anymore. Click on movies &gt;&gt;&gt; year &gt;&gt;&gt; does nothing. Over and over. Have to search individually. Not amusing in the least. Looking for alternate provider. Your latest update isn't working well at all and is not user friendly.,5,02/04/2017,2
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I have used Kodi on my TV through my Nvidia Android System...For the most part I liked it _  but crashed a lot especially during peak viewing times...now with the Krypton update _  can not get to work at all.  I have zero clue how to go about getting it set up _  and like others have mentioned no way to back out of a screen if you select something you don't need.  So very confusing _  going to stick with Amazon Video for now and see if I can figure this new Kodi out.  It is horrible!!!!,1,02/02/2017,11
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Great app for all new movies _  box sets _  live sports and movies and now kodi 17 has just come out on android. Only problem I see is that I want an option for it to have a Chromecast option so I can send movies to my tv.,5,02/02/2017,7
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Layout is annoying. Why change something that worked well. Light back screen ugly. Original dark better. Most annoying problem is when kodi starts a loud crackle comes through the speakers. The same when the video selected starts. Feels like the speakers are going to blow up. Fix this problem and review will change.,1,03/01/2017,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,The new update is absolutely rubbish. You cant navigate because nothing is labeled _  just unidentifiable pictures. Nothing is where it used to be so you cant even navigate by memory. Im now going to  remove kodi from my device because its unusable. Welldone _  you've took a perfectly simple app that didn't need fixing and broke it.,1,02/08/2017,2
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Does nothing. There are no instructions that I can find _  so it is just a file browser that shows all my media folders as empty. Which they are not. Big hype _  no delivery.,1,02/09/2017,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,This is the best media player apps. That I've haven't had before. Since I install this just now. I start to uninstall some of my apps in my mobile. I really like this apps I often use this daily. I love the interface _  the  combination of color very cool in my eyes. So I give 2x5 star.😍😘😄,5,03/07/2017,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I had to uninstall the previous version to solve the issue of Krypton crashing on start up. Works great now. My only wish is that this app could be installed on the sd card ....it really eats up your storage and needs it's cache cleared constantly.,4,02/20/2017,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,The new update to this krypton is not good at all everytime i go to enter the app it ethee comes up a black screne and boots me out or just boots me out. Could yous please fix this soon please as i loved using kodi before it was the streaming app out there and now it doesn't work,2,02/09/2017,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,It freezes every time I try to open it. Version 17 no good yet. Updated automatically didn't even want the update. Stay with v. 16 until 17 is stable enough,1,02/05/2017,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I originally had this app at a 5 star rating until the update. All of my add ons updated and now no longer work and half the time Kodi itself crashes ... I'm not very impressed with this update.,1,02/04/2017,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Jarvis was great. After autoupdate to 17.1 on my Sony android TV I  can't even open it. All I see is a black screen. Deleting cache _   data doesn't help. The worst update ever. Really hate it.,1,02/03/2017,14
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Waste of time _  the old one was better. No pvr backend  client in this one.  You guys just made something  that was  so simple _  so complicated now. Thanks for taking simplicity  of technology  backwards.  So dumb. Why do updates and new versions make thinnhs more difficult  instead of easier?,1,02/20/2017,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Hen using exodus app freezer entire device and I have to force shutdown in the middle if a movie or anything I am watching. CAUTION DO NOT upgrade from 16.1 to 17. This will make exodus unusable. I app didn't freeze I would give this a much better review. Oh and by the way kodi is actually illegal.,1,03/01/2017,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Do not like the Krypton update. I want Jarvis back and don't know how to get it back on my tablet. Krypton is more difficult and unable to customize background images and other aspects. Completely disappointed in Krypton. If it ain't broke _  don't fix it.,2,02/05/2017,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I can't even get this app to even open.  The first screen keeps saying "waiting for external storage" What external item is it waiting for? Kodi worker perfectly fine before the forced upgrade. Now I have to uninstall it and hope that fixes this problem.,1,02/10/2017,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Used an older version without issue. The latest version is useless. The touch screen is way out. Doesn't matter where you click on the screen. It seems to randomly choose a button to click. Where can i download an older working version from.,1,02/03/2017,3
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I don't like the new interface. On Jarvis I had my shortcuts on my main front page and here it has useless tabs that I removed and bla bla bla I don't like it. Why fix something that ain't broke grrr,3,02/01/2017,25
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Love it _  once I can figure out how to get it set up & working. A friend did it for me the first time & it got accidentally uninstalled. Now I'm trying to figure it out. Ugh...ahhhh,5,02/21/2017,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Confusing interface _  I can't find my way around it after using the previous version for ages.  The lack of a back button is really frustrating _  which sums up this version up in one word.,1,02/15/2017,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Great universal app _  slightly sad about my addons getting deleted after the new update but I am loving the new look so that kinda forgives it haha. Will definitely update Kodi on PC.   All in all a great media app with tons of addons and a lot usability _  must download. May be hard to navigate but you'll get used to it.,4,03/07/2017,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,One of the worst releases ever! It couldn't migrate my addons and now all I get is a black screen. I hope I can go back to Jarvis.,1,02/02/2017,6
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,New version _  17.0 Krypton I believe is fine minus one problem I found while using exodus on Android. The problem is the audio is not working while trying to watch movies or shows. Downloaded the same version on my Mac without issues.,2,02/25/2017,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Kodi was fantastic until updated. Unfortunately now when I watch anything the screen flashes blue every 5 seconds or so make it unwatchable. Anybody else had this problem? Hope this is fixed soon as was a great app and would get 5 stars otherwise,1,02/14/2017,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,This new version is so difficult to find the simplest options......I don't understand why kodi Devs have made a previously easy to use media centre a now awkward and terrible user experience. I like to see improvements but this new version has taken a massive step away from the idea of a simple to use program. I'm sure all the new features are marvelous but I can't figure out what they are with this horrific new front end!,1,02/07/2017,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Don't see why everyone is complaining.... The update gives it a fresh new feel _  looks good. My addons work fine with no extras setup. People clearly have problems with change..... It's a good thing.,5,02/04/2017,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Search! Everything was fine but now the app won't open at all! I've tried reinstalling it _  but to no avail! This has dropped from 5 ton1 star _  but it would be 0 of there was that option.,5,02/19/2017,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I have loved this app since I first heard of it. When the krypton update first came out I was happy with it. But suddenly the app stopped working and wouldn't open. I've kept it installed in case it starts working again _  and I'm hoping that that it gets fixed.,3,03/13/2017,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,The previous edition I had worked perfectly until this update. This version is not easy to navigate and cannot download any add ons. I much preferred the older version. I've lost all my saved programmes. 😭,1,02/01/2017,26
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Forced update into a change with zero upside and a great deal of downside! Many apps no longer work including my favourite skin. 'Addon Installer' rendered pretty much useless. I Uninstaller 17 and reinstalled 16.1! This morning 17 was forced updated once again!  How do you stop force updates!?,1,02/04/2017,4
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Damb the auto update. This is by far the worse one yet. Its not as easy to navigate or place repos on. I just simply dont like it and i guess im not on my own,1,02/02/2017,11
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Hate the new layout. Im not the brightest of people and I Cant find how to do anything. Just trying to put exodus on has taken me 45 minutes and its still not done. The old version was easier to use.,3,02/16/2017,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Forced install lost settings and most of the add on. I'm all for updates but this update is an updated to far . Way to many changes . Lori was fixed for the sake of fixing. Now going to do an uninstall to see if I can get back what I've lost by reinstalling . THERE IS A SAYING IF NOT BROKEN DON'T FIX IT,1,02/03/2017,7
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Compared to past editions of Kodi _  this update is absolutely horrible. Navigation makes no sense _  I seem to find add-ons by accident. Most of the time is spent trying to back out of sections I didn't want to be in. If you are already running Jarvis _  please _  for the love of God _  don't install the update!,1,02/01/2017,36
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Auto update from 16 to 17 broken my home cinema (Matricom GBox rooted with last firmware 2.2).Kodi 16 was working very well but now video is choppy. I need to know how to downgrade.,1,02/21/2017,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Have had kodi for a long time but now it has updated to the Krypton it doesn't work cannot even get it to open!! What is happening loved it up until you decided to update it and now I've lost it all!,1,02/02/2017,19
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Way too complex for the average person. Unless you're an IT professional or hobbyist or are prepared to sit through long tutorials don't waste your time downloading. Shame it's virtually unusable to vast majority of people. Stick with Netflix.,1,03/17/2017,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,So the new layout... Clumsy on PC cause you can only navigate properly with the keyboard and entirely unusable on a touchscreen cause there's no way to back out of a screen or exit kodi without turning off the device. Good work Dingus.,1,02/10/2017,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Sorry but don't like this at all. Jumpy menus are my main bugbear. Press on one thing and it either jumps to the one above or below. Uninstalling and going back to Jarvis that was fine,2,02/04/2017,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,5-1. Just received automatic upgrade to the version and now Kodi refuses to open! All my hard work setting up addons has come to nothing thanks to this! Was the upgrade from Jarvis even tested correctly!?? I guess not! Thanks a bunch!,1,02/02/2017,10
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Want 16.1 back. The 17 upgrade does not work _  cant find anything as navi x will not support on android. There was nothing wrong with 16.1 so why change it!? not impressed at all.,1,02/02/2017,5
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I just got the new update & now not only does everything NOT WORK _  but now kodi also crashes & force closes every single time after I try to open kodi.   It's ridiculous _  I don't have this kind of TIME to keep fixing new problems because YOU DEVS feel that it's needed to force new updates on everyone when the update doesn't work for everyone.   Now kodi is nothing _  but a waste of space on my phone thanks morons.,1,02/05/2017,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I love the update the movie's that I am watching come out perfectly clear. I would give it 5 stars if someone can help me with this problem I have. When I screen mirror the app on my tv the app goes dim and the movie's are too dark to watch. I've gone to the settings to change the contrast and brightness but it is not helping. So can anyone give me any suggestions?,4,02/14/2017,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I don't know what you did with the update _  but it is TERRIBLE. I loved it before. It was easy to maneuver through and the menus moved on in seconds. Now it's a little more complicated and it takes forever to move to the next menu. Put it back the old way or fix this issue immediately.,3,02/04/2017,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Jarvis was almost perfect. The menu system on Krypton is so long winded. Basically _  they spent time and money to make it worse...,1,02/05/2017,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,New version (kryton) became none user friendly _  not intuitive at all. Scroll sucks. No back button every 2 pages. Bring back the old interface...... At lease if you change something make it better not worse.,1,02/21/2017,7
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Jervis is almost flawless... most of my add-ons fail with dependency issues. How can I get the old version for my tablet,1,02/16/2017,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,This new update sucks. I can no longer watch effortlessly. It plays fine but all I hear is static no matter what I try to watch. Please fix this quickly and you will definitely get 5 stars.,1,03/25/2017,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,The kodi app was awesome until recent update and is no longer responding. I dont know what to do at this point. I press the app and it freezes my phone. Please fix and will give 5 stars,5,02/17/2017,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Next to useless for live TV _   constantly buffering  _ channel not streaming or only streaming with descriptive narration _  and I've tried all the major addons. However  Live TV addons aren't official kodi addons so that's not a fault with kodi _  it's just that's all I wanted it for. (Edit) it seems you need a really strong WiFi connection _  much stronger than I need for streaming via SkyGo or Web streams I've been using.  With full bars of strength it seems OK _   Kodi 17 isn't stable though and the new UI is a mess,3,02/14/2017,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Not work good on my Media player Tronsmart Telos S95 Amlogic S905 for 4K (UHD) videos. Not continues play. With Kodi 16.1 was everithing OK but with 17.0 is not good.,2,02/04/2017,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Old version awesome. New version impossible to use on touchscreens _  slow to reload after watching video _  and many links broken. Fix or bring back a version that works. :(,1,02/07/2017,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Best invention ever use it very often...  Was a 5 Star till the new update. . It won't even work anymore. Want the old version back!!! Read your complaints everybody went from loving this to hating it because of your new update get rid of this stupid update and fix it sooner rather than later or I'll be deleting this and giving a zero Star as possible.,3,03/20/2017,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Quite like the new look _  it will take time to get used to _  my only problem is there doesn't seem to be any back button in the interface so use the tablets one _  maybe I need to play with it more. Thanks for a great app,4,02/02/2017,5
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Kodi exodos has so many movies and tv shows on it i love it. The only thing i do'nt like is how you can't fast forward very easy but overall its a great app 👌👍,5,02/02/2017,4
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I want it back the way it was. PLEASE _  PLEASE CHANGE IT BACK EVERYONE INCLUDING ME HATES THIS UPDATE. I feel like I am using a much worse app than it is,1,02/02/2017,13
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Installed on phone and got nothing but a terrible static sound from the start. I have a new phone with 7.0 android so I don't see what the problem is. I would love to rate it higher but its completely unusable like this.,1,02/28/2017,2
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Seems my issue has been solved I can access the favourite and queue menu with the x button once more and balance seems to have restored in the universe. The new default seems tricky but looks better on the eye if I can figure how it works ill probably just use it as a base,5,02/02/2017,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Unworkable. Had it figured before _  now can't find anything. Just wanted TV shows _  no idea where to start now (again).,1,02/07/2017,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,So I like the app but since the update I cannot watch movies anymore I am mad,5,02/01/2017,6
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,What have you done to your interface? It's been great _ then an update on my tablet has made it really hard work _  so touchy that you can't even select the right streams without the whole screen rolling about. So annoying as my last setup was perfect.,3,02/04/2017,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,At first i didnt know how to get movies but then I went under add ons and found list of music _  movies _  and TV shows! This is a great app,4,02/14/2017,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Great app _  been using the beta version for a while now and has improved alot _  i like the new default skin. It may be a bit complicated to start with but dont take long to get use to it. Keep up the good work ⛤⛤⛤⛤⛤⛤⛤⛤⛤,5,02/02/2017,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,The old version was better. This ones to much messing about _  I'm left with 4 topics on the opening page now as its too complicated to sort out. Radio  _ favorites all gone. .,2,02/02/2017,12
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,The developers would have saved people a lot of grief by keeping Jarvis in Play store. Were they unaware that Play Store automatically updates and that that would cause chaos? I understand that Krypton only supports the latest Android versions.  What about those with earlier versions? Without 2 Kodi versions on Play Store how do you prevent a working Jarvis Kodi being automatically replaced by Krypton Kodi which will not work? I am not making any further donations to development if I need to buy a new Android phone and tablet every time a new Kodi version comes out.,4,02/03/2017,2
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,The new update has broken all of the hard work I did to set it up the way I wanted it. At least give us back Jarvis _  that was a stable build. This new kodi isn't ready for general public release.,1,02/14/2017,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,There is a classic saying in this country. "If it's Not broken _  do Not fix it. I do Not like the Kodi Krypton  version at all. There was Nothing wrong with the 2016 _  2015 versions. Last year's version was a real 5 stars.  I tried adding Kodi Krypton  5 or 6 times and plus I also wanted the Israel TV shows too.  Now I get 100 percent of Nothing. And even worse _  I can Not get the last year's or 2015 year's version. I can't even get Sports Devil anymore.  Please give us the option to re-add the older version of Kodi. Please send old Kodi back as an option for those of us who wants it.,2,02/06/2017,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Kodi is the best free media player available! I use it on all my devices from mine and my family's phone's to our laptops and desktops. It's super simple to use _  simple to tweek and modify as well as setup for kids. The huge selection of movie _  tv _  music and other media addon's is amazing! You don't have to worry about viruses from sketchy websites _  it keeps getting better with every new version and my  firewall doesn't even twitch!,5,02/03/2017,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Nice _  Just a few things. 1 _  It jumps back to the top of the list after previewing a movie. 2 _  the view type changes back. 3 _  I Can't preview movies that I have added to favorites.,5,02/03/2017,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I hate the new update. It is so slow when I try to use my add-ons. I can't even barely watch movies and it takes forever to load and list things. Half the time it doesn't even work. I rarely had this problem before the update. I wish I could go back to the older version. This update is terrible.,1,02/03/2017,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Used to be the best. Now it crashes on startup. Still works great on the home server (Linux) i guess the android devs are so clever they made it fail.. Shame really.,3,03/25/2017,0

Why fix what s not broken?...... you guys are seriously going to lose major stars with this update   YOU GUYS JUST MADE THE EXACT SAME MISTAKE THAT MICROSOFT MADE WHEN THEY CREATED WINDOWS 8. PEOPLE HATED IT _  THEY DROPPED IT AND IT GAVE BIRTH TO WINDOWS 10 WHICH WAS SIMILAR TO WINDOWS 7 AND USER FRIENDLY..PLEASE LEARN FROM THEM _  THEY LOST MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND GOT MILLIONS OF COMPLAINTS!

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,App still works just fine after the update _  contrary to lots of top reviews on here. Just be sure to go through all the various settings & make all the necessary changes. Also _  to those that don't like the new skin/interface _  the previous default skin Confluence is still available. You just have to download it under "skin settings" _  "get more " _  and then configure it to your liking.,5,02/02/2017,4

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Been using Kodi (xbmc) from day one and it's gone from being one of the best applications around to becoming absolutely terrible.  The latest update on android and the Windows 10 appstore is unreliable _  has an overly complex fiddly unintuitive interface and the software itself has become buggie as hell.   The original native windows version that we have come to love on the last version was by far the last best version to date.  The latest Android and Windows App store version is junk to be honest.  No doubt the developers have put lots of effort in to the new version _  but they seem to have somehow ruined what was once one of the best apps around by complicating it and making it unreliable.  The android app in its current form has literally caused my android devices to physically lock up on multiple occasions that I've actually needed to hard reboot my device to get it functioning again.. What good is that?,1,02/13/2017,3
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I AM SO ANGRY AT THIS KODI USED TO WORK ON JARVIS 16.1 BUT ALL I GET NOW ARE CRASHES EITHER SOMEONE HELP ME OUT OR JUST ADD A JARVIS TO THE STORE PLEASE,2,02/06/2017,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,They F-ed it up _  been using kodi for quite a while now _  I think 17 is the worst release. Broken directory cache _  broken url resolver _  etc etc. Yep the playback quality and directory management is increased a lot and also if one is using the built in skin its quite fluent but what I liked most about kodi is the capability of customization and skinning which is f ed up in kodi 17. Going back to 16.1 _  no wonder they are rushing to 18. 17 i think in a whole is kind of like vista...i seriously hope 18 will be windows 7 😋,2,03/10/2017,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,This newest update makes it not as user friendly. I lost everything _  and it is more difficult to find what I added back onto the newer version. Is there anyway I can revert back to the older version of Kodi?,2,02/03/2017,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Like others have said they have caused most builds not to work. This should be a seperate app to allow people to keep version 16.1. I've lost my setup that I have been using for at least 2 years. I've even sideloaded 16.1 and the play store updates it to version 17 anyways even tho it was uninstalled.,1,02/02/2017,1

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Ok _  since the Devs are not chiming in on the current issue everyone is having _  I will enlightened you on what your issue and fix are. After you download the app _  you will need to go to settings &gt; interface &gt; skin and change your skin to estouchy. It says in the description that you will need to use this skin for touchscreen devices. The backdraw to that is you will need to make some adjustments to your addons if you are not running an interface that already have them programmed. But it works and it works every time. Enjoy everyone...,4,03/07/2017,0

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Updated to 17. Was hesitant after reading reviews but thankfully all worked perfectly. My builds are custom so no premade cram every app in build.. which might have helped the transition be so smooth. People may also want you consider clearing their cache before starting app and if it looks screwed _  before you panic _  try going to skin settings and selecting your old skin. It may just solve the problem. (As with previous updates it's defaulted skin removing all my custom shortcuts _  but to get it back to my build all I had to do was change my skin back. Luckily mo such problems here.)  Seems nice and runs fluid! Good job to the Devs. We all appreciate your work!,5,02/01/2017,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Was best app on play store but lost a star for the update. Not as bad as everyone thinks (if you want jarvis 16.1 menu go settings &gt; interface &gt; skin &gt; get more &gt; confluence or Aeon Nox or Xonfluence what ever skin you previously favoured.

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,When I installed Nougat _  Kodi stopped working and now every time I open it _  there is no text on screen (I remember layout by heart but can't change skin or add add-ons). It simple shows Video Music Settings and Programs and black boxes for their subcategories with no text. It tries giving me a message when I start Kodi up _  but it has no words _   only a blue bottom that if I touch it makes it go away. I don't know why this happens but if it helps I have the ZTE axon 7 and Nougat.,1,01/09/2017,2

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Excellent,5,09/29/2016,23
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Absolutely love love love this app. I have it on my android media box and it has endless stuff to watch. You can even watch TV live in your area as well as other regions. It is more up to date than hulu. With hulu you have to wait until the next day after it airs to watch. Kodi most the time has it on there an hour after it airs. In some cases I have seen it on there before it airs..... So yes by far the best &lt;3,5,01/20/2017,2
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,This is quite possibly the most impressive app that I've used for Android. I love it _  apart from one issue that's recently been coming up. The library no longer seems to update on the skin widget for recommended episodes _  unless I exit and open Kodi again. Until maybe a week ago _  it automatically updated after watching one of the episodes listed there. Now _  it's not working that way.,4,03/08/2017,5
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I dont know why this just started happing to me but the movie or show wont load as fast as it did when i first downloaded the app i think youbguy might have a bug plz fix and my rate will go to a five. Please fix it. I know it might not be happing to others but i know im not the only person that this is happing to and that mean you losing user's. Just giving a heads up. But this app is really good though would recommend it to other.,3,08/11/2016,152
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I love this app and so glad I was told about it. It is so awesome cuz it cuts the cost of having to buy a roku or some other type of media streamer as well as 100% free _  commercial free paid subscriptions. I get any and all movies from SD to 1080p quality. It's a life saver from having to ever watch TV or pay for cable and Netflix. It's a must download!,5,01/01/2017,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,i have Kodi installed in my Sony Android TV as the stock video player isn't the most intuitive when playing movies in my hard drive. the guys in the store recommended other popular players ("V" and "MX") but both are total duds. was even frustrated to start thinking about returning the tv. a quick Google search showed kodi in Android authority's top 10 best players.i tried it and it's just awesome _  the interface is much better than the other 2. video files are showed by folder _  just awesome.,5,12/19/2016,2
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I would die without this program. I use it every single day. A lot of aspects of it do require some technological knowledge _  and when you discover the good sources _  the entertainment is seamless. I'm learning new things about it every day _  and I'm always looking for great addons. Five stars is not a high enough rating for this app _  I really appreciate all the hard work you guys do to make this possible. Can't wait until v.17 is finished!,5,09/01/2016,51
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,For Android it is the best media player  for playing all formats _  but when it comes to its interface it is not compfortable to operate because it's default ui as in desktop icons and switches are very small to touch so kodi team need to think this making ui familiar and easy like other player mx player where ui is very easy and it no need to add videos manually _  no matter where you put videos in any folder mx player can show it in its list.,3,04/25/2016,390
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,The only people who rate this app less than 5 stars are the ones who are technically challenged. I have this app on my android T.V.  _  I have boxes _  and on all my devices. I have not used cable TV in over 2 years and have not had any problems. There are apps you can download for casting to T.V. and just about anything else you can imagine. I suggest you spend some time on Youtube educating yourself on the nuances of this wonderful software that is the forerunner of the future of television.,5,08/28/2016,93
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I love Kodi. On my old Droid Turbo 2 phone it was great! But when I loaded it on my new Z-Force Droid phone it started acting weird. *If* it opens without crashing _  the text doesn't show up in the text boxes & buttons. So I can't navigate enough to see if anything else works or not... Help please!,2,12/23/2016,5
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Kodi is the number 1 app that have everything in it. All you need is to build it with the right add-ons to work 100% Very easy to build it by yourself. Alot of videos on youtube shows you how to install everything for your choice. Never had problem from kodi from version 14.1 till now. It's a must to have it in these days,5,02/04/2017,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,If I had to choose one gripe... Every time I switch to a different app and then go back to Kodi it acts as though it's the first time I ever ran the app and "first time run" tips pop up. I lose my video and have to go through the whole process of manually searching for it and I often lose my place. But sometimes it resumes from where I left off. Also _  the buttons are quite small but other than that this app is a stroke of genius and well deserving of 5 stars. I would (and will) recommend it to many others.,5,07/14/2016,27
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,When navigating menus with video playing in background cannot quickly close without going all the way back home.  When searching _  should populate results with each character input. Should show similar movies/shows. Rating system? Recommended titles based on view history?,5,10/24/2016,4
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Hello _  thanks for all your hard work. My family and I are daily users and we LOVE KODI. We also use 3 Google Chromecast units daily and we would greatly appreciate having the option to have our phones screens off with the capability to Cast/watch Kodi from our Android Kodi apps on our TV's from our Nexus 6P's. You know _  similar to the casting option of the Android Netflix app but Kodi style. Please let us know if and when this will happen as we look forward to using this option soon.  Best regards _  Jonah,4,08/21/2016,28
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,It is a grest media center app with insane amounts of functions but... for one: needs to be designed to use android keyboard when using any of the searching and typing related functions. Video should have a lock function so there is no way to accidently do something on your phone.. that causes you to start over completely and have to go to the same thing you were previously streaming from scratch.. that being said _  it would be nice to return to exactly where you were on a video after minimizing.,4,06/17/2016,22
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,New update works great.  Don't like the skin change it back to confluence.  Addons not working?  well thats up to the addon dev's not Kodi devs.  Dont upgrade til you know your addons are working. Same thing with Windows people... Its clear most of the 1stars dont know how kodi works.   Kodi dev's A+ work.  Keep it up.,5,02/02/2017,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Caio (USTVnow Support) Dec 31 _  2:48 PM EST  Hi Don _   Our XBMC support is limited because the plug in is developed and maintained by a 3rd party. XBMC/Kodi is not listed as compatible with Ustvnow.  Who supports this if you buy the pay version?,1,01/03/2017,2
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,No bugs _  no glitches. I have it on my phone and my computer and never had a single issue. Sometimes you might have to hunt a little bit for a stream that works but it's well worth it.,5,08/09/2016,71
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,If you're after an app to stream the Premier League this season _  and you want something that works less than 10% of the time and streams with the quality of Lego then this is the app for you! If you want reliable _  good quality video then I'm afraid you're going to have to subscribe to Sky and/or BT Sport. Sorry. I can't comment about watching any other content _  so this review is only written for people searching for viable Premier League viewing options. Reminds me of watching Sky Mobile TV on my Nokia N95.,3,08/07/2016,13
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I absolutely love this application _  but the issue I have is that it doesn't have cast support for things like the Chrome Cast. If you plan to add this in a later update or do add it I'll be highly inclined to change my review to a 5 star. My rating probably doesn't concern you much but it would just be a great feature to have.,4,07/11/2016,221
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I love this app!! It's the best thing ever! You can really find anything you want on it. I love the convenience of being able to watch movies and TV shows and get my music in one app. Instead of this one for that an this one for that. I literally use this app everyday. Mostly on my Amazon Fire stick. I can't sing it's praises enough! 😁,5,10/26/2016,5
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,The best multi platform streaming and multimedia home theater all in one app ever.  Runs on everything. Takes a little learning to set up _  but then it's limitless in terms of what it can do _  and the streaming content is also limitless.  No wonder the big media companies are pooping in their pants.,5,09/15/2016,3
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Yeah _  its cool that it's cross-platform _  but it's not an android app. It's a desktop app on a tiny mobile phone screen. Lists are hard to navigate let alone the main menu. Any clickable items are ridiculously small _  I can't even imagine someone with meaty fingers trying to use this app. Other than the UI being awful _  it's one of the best. Thanks for your hard work.,3,05/10/2016,62
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Better than every other media app if you know how to use it. Basically you have to install apps inside this app _  which brings near endless content for your viewing pleasure. Have trouble viewing anime or something on your browser? There's apps on here that will let you play it just fine. The only problem is the steep learning curve and unfriendly way to find certain applications _  but in the end it's well worth it.,5,05/28/2016,64
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I dont need Netflix _  Hulu or Funimation now i have everything on here for free _  movies playing  in the theater's i watch it on Kodi for free!! 💪💪 and to metion the best part live tv including pay-per-view boxing _  UFC fights and every other sports live!! I have to say this is the best app out on the play store,5,12/02/2016,6
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Cant believe its taken me so long to find out about Kodi. Ever since I started using it a few months ago _  i dont know how I ever went without it. To the large team of people who develop _  support _  and continue to keep this app thriving _  thank you very much for your work and what you do.,5,12/15/2016,3
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Truly a work of art! The concept and its genius layout is simply beautiful. A bit difficult to fully understand and use for the average user _  but the possibilities are endless. I think with more a little layout design and some time to iron out the coding and flaws it will be a staple app on all smart phones.,5,09/16/2016,3
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,This is what I have on my firestick ! Couldn't believe it when I seen it. Installed it with a certain degree of scepticism but then I installed the Kryptonite build on and now I can watch anything I want whenever I want. It's like an uber version of sky go and virgin anywhere built into one BUT MUCH MUCH BETTER. You don't have to pay anything !!,5,05/02/2016,10
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Been using it since the old xbmc days and just gets better. To all those people who down vote it because they can't get streams working or watch free movies that has nothing to do with Kodi. That's the fault of the person who wrote the pirate addon your using . So moan to them. The people behind this are absolute legends!,5,05/12/2016,15
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Works Great with 1 limitation that I encountered.  I have tons of DVD ISO files on my network smb storage accessible with FTP externally _  which is found and browsed within Kodi.    However _  it will open any Folder that contains ISO files _  but the folder shows as EMPTY.  The only workaround I have found is to use a File Browser (ES File Manager) to browse to the folder containing the ISO files. TO WORK _  I then need to select the ISO file >> View as Video >> choose Kodi player app and it gets loaded and streamed (not download) totally correctly.     SO - can the developers please code the ability to view and open the ISO file itself like the ES File Manager app does _  so we can browse _  select and play all from within KODI app????  thanks.  - gschlact,4,09/04/2016,6
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I have a Fire Stick with Kodi and it works FANTASTIC. But I added the app to my phone and it WAS working just as well - but last week _  it quit working. When I open the app _  the screen just goes black or immediately closes. Not sure what happened,4,10/04/2016,2
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Love the app and I would give it 5 stars but theirs been a bug I recently found. This app would work for about week and after that it wouldn't let me open the app. I tried to force stop it but no luck. I have an android and it might be just my devices but I have tried it on other devices still the same results. I have to uninstall and install it to get it working. I'm really annoyed and hoped they fix this.,2,05/29/2016,67
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I use kodi all the time on RasPi and it's fine. But on Doogee F5 this v16 totters _  starts IPlayer video for maybe 1 minute _  sound drops out 1 min later _  then video _  then kodi stumbles _  bangs head on sideboard and bites carpet. maybe Doogee strangeness _  but still no use to me. Also has trouble finding NFS shares.,2,08/23/2016,11
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I have a NAS hard drive loaded with my personal video collection.  I have Kodi on all my mobile devices and can watch videos in any format with this.  Other media players choke on one format or another _  but Kodi plays everything.  Beats VLC _  MX Player _  Jetaudio _  you name it!,5,10/06/2016,6
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Wow! Been trying for over a year  to get season 6 of walking  dead since i lost  cable few weeks before it  came out _  I tried everything  _  every program .  This is first  one that actually  worked  _  and free! Unbelievable! Y didn't  I find this  12 months  ago !,5,08/02/2016,14
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I love the app _  especially being that it is free. However _  as of lately _  it has been crashing constantly. I didn't want to have to rate it so poorly _  but it refuses to stop crashing _  buffering _  and showing PVR link is not connected which interferes with other viewing options. Please fix these issues.,3,10/14/2016,8
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Love it. One star off because I think User interface could be a little better. I know it's not for the novice _  but it is such a powerful app _  it could be just a little smoother and maybe a quick 3-4 step tutorial initially that can be skipped but is available on basic navigation.,4,11/20/2016,2
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Great application for watching videos _   interface is very small on a phone though and hard to navigate. When streaming audio over Bluetooth it most often does not work. If you connect the Bluetooth device after the audio has started _   sometimes it works.,3,10/13/2016,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I have this app on my Nvidia Shield Android tv box and I mainly use the Exodus video add-on to stream movies and TV shows. If you decide to use this app then I suggest that you install the Exodus video add-on first thing _  as it will probably end up being the video add-on that you will use the most _  if it doesn't end up being the only video add-on you will use. Another good video add-on is the Phoenix add-on to stream movies and TV with.,5,08/17/2016,14
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I've seen few others commenting about the same thing so I'm also requesting for the same thing to support them. Why not use phone's default keyboard? Life would have been much easier! Please consider users requests for your own good! Cheers!,4,07/12/2016,24
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I'm only giving this a stars because if your watching anything on mobile and you just happen to get a phone call it stops the movie and absouletly REFUSES to let you resume where you left off which sucks when your almost finished with a movie and nope sorry can't play that,2,07/27/2016,8
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I was anxious to use this. First time user. What a disappointment. The controls are so small. Then try to get it working. you need a master's degree to do anything. Nothing intuitive about. Unless you want to spends hours to figure it out just go on with your life without this.,1,07/18/2016,11
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I've installed it before _  and I still can't manage to like the app. I'm computer literate so idk why I can't seem to like this app. Maybe the UI it's not too attractive or too intuitive... either way I decided to give it another try because again _  I keep seeing good reviews everywhere on different sites. If everything goes well _  I'll update the app to 5⭐,3,06/14/2016,42
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Stopped working _  now crashes every time I try to play my m3u list. Reinstalled but the problem persists.  The issue is not with the list as I am now using a different app and have no problems. Every New Version Seemed To Be Heavier Than The Previous And Now This 16.1 Simply Doesn't Work. Very disappointed with this android version of kodi.,1,05/05/2016,4
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Exodus is not available directly slight bummer. But those familiar with Kodi know it's the best platform for new movies! Once installed just follow Google how to add exodus.... I'm now watching all the newest movies! Thanks Kodi so much! Best platform for movies and live TV!,5,01/23/2017,7
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,This app is great _  can watch anything on it. The issue I have is that it's just the desktop app scaled down _  making it difficult to operate on a phone with all the small buttons. It would be great if this app got a phone type interface to make it more user friendly.,3,11/16/2016,2
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Update with Ares Wizard _  find Pulse CCM and use that _  streams supported a lot more _  those with parse issues may want to upgrade android as Jarvis 16.1 on prefers later Android builds (4.4.4 on). Absolutely excellent app _  on my Xperia Z3 I use it as electronic programme guide and stream via Fire Tv Stick.,5,06/01/2016,66
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,All of a sudden the sound does not work it comes out distorted and doesn't sound clear at all. It doesn't happen to all the movies but most of them it doesn't work. This is if i try to watch is directly from the phone before i use my dongle. Does anyone have a solution to this issue please help,3,10/08/2016,2
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Have to go In settings - video - acceleration - turn off AMCODEC ... but its a better image quality with it on. Wonderful product love it have it on everything.. recommend it highly... Please please please can you fix the AMCODEC crash issue for us users. Previous version of Android I did not have the issue only crashes on version 6.,3,11/22/2016,38
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Won't play any movies _  shows or music. All it does is keep trying to make me download add-ons for random things. I haven't even seen one movie _  TV show or song to try and stream or download.,1,08/28/2016,10
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Great app. I think some other reviewers are confusing the performance of the app with the performance off the Add Ons within it. The Add Ons are nothing to do with Kodi and if they aren't working properly it's probably something to do with the add on itself or the links contained within the add on. To complain about the volume on a film within a link _  within an add on _  within Kodi makes me wonder how technically savvy some reviewers are. Kodi is simply a platform and _  as such _  works very well indeed. There are lots of YouTube videos out there _  some good and some bad _  that can offer help in getting the best out of Kodi and will show you which Add Ons are better than others. Have a bit of patience (I'm still learning) and you will eventually enjoy the whole experience.,5,09/01/2016,10
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Firstly _  by far the best media player out there. Secondly _  it's stupid people that rate low because they've added a repo to watch cam releases _  only to blame Kodi for the poor audio or quality. Think about it you morons...,5,08/17/2016,14
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,For those upset with a lack of support for Chromecast _  i just cast my whole phone screen to the tv. If audio is off you can adjust the audio offset in the settings. Works well enough for me,5,08/26/2016,7
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Have on tablet I can get all the football matches plus lots of sport and lots of movies .just takes time to find a stream that works but not a big problem saves me money on sky sports _ by sports _ and movies. Plus movies are right up to date no problem with buffing at all love this app wish I had found it sooner 😍ps people who rate 1 or 2 star say they cant get movies dont know how to use the app can get all the new films and tv shows and live tv for free,5,09/17/2016,4
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,This app will allow you to stream live broadcast tv _  movies and TV shows like Netflix and HULU only Netflix and HULU do not have all movies and all TV shows. Kodi with the right  player you can watch pretty much any movie there ever was and some that are even in theatres! You can also watch any TV show there ever was and even those that aired that day! Only negative is it can be a bit buggy but it's well worth the hassles. Best player for movies & TV is Genesis. Kodi also does music & more!!!!,5,06/19/2016,10
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I love this app and always have but I got a new phone on Monday so I had to reinstall Kodi. Well literally the next day my Droid Moto Z Force was updated to Nougat 7.0 and now Kodi doesn't work at all. After installing it _  it opens fine but there aren't any words in the tabs provided. I can't download anything at all because nothing shows up. Hopefully this means that there is an update coming for the newer software on phones.,2,12/23/2016,2
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Great way to snip the cable from your home; more than enough tv/vid/music for anyone. KODI free but you still may need to spend som $$ on a VPN and a few subsciptiondms for enhanced viewing but it is still cheaper than cable/satellite. It has excelent support. I LIKE IT _  WIFE TOO,5,09/05/2016,3
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I bought the app and I Don t mind how much I have to pay but I want it works. And work well but partially. The streaming option not work well on my different tv. The setup is not really friendly. Sorry guys make it better and you will get more $$$,2,12/31/2016,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,For watching TV Show & Movies! Only problem I have is Black programming isn't always there. The pictures for the shows are but when you click on it _   it says no links. I'm not talking my stars away because you guys are still AWESOME! But if you could correct the problem that would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for all that you do!,5,04/24/2016,45
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,What can i say?  I love it. Its changed my life!  Not all of us can afford a television _  never mind paying for cable or satellite.  I use my laptop as my telly got smashed a while ago. So _  to Kodi _  thank you from tge bottomof my heart. Xxxxx😘😗😙😍,5,06/13/2016,12
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Excellent media player but gave 4 stars instead of 5 because cannot hear audio (music streaming)from my bluetooth speakers.  This problem started with latest versions of kodi. Thanks.,4,05/17/2016,25
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,since update it freezes and content buffers and lags badly _  done all usual fixes clear cache uninstall reinstal etc.. will give another week see what happens _  it NO LONGER CONNECTS TO TRAKT,3,11/29/2016,2
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I have Kodi on my TV _  but this is amazing! 😘 This is SO much better than YouTube! And there's a show called " Haters back Off!" And you put it on your app! 😉👌 Thnx for the creator of this app! 😘😹👍,5,10/15/2016,2
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Kodi itself is awesome and I love it. Use it everyday. Functionality wise it works perfectly. The only reason it's not 5 stars is that I would like to see a more intuitive native mobile app in the future. It's kinda hard to press buttons as it's basically just a smaller version of the desktop app. But that's not worth giving a bad review for as it's still useable and works perfectly fine.,4,05/01/2016,31
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I have never used a more useful media app. Not all the stuff works and if you don't know how to install add ons use youtube otherwise its impossoble to learn. But 9/10!!,5,08/13/2016,8
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,The app freezes quite a bit so I have to cancel it from the recent apps tab. Also for no apparent reason the controls have disappeared while watching videos (they were then when I first installed) so I now have no way of resizing the video to fill the screen.,3,08/21/2016,4
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Saw this on top media player's list on androidauthority and downloaded for my 8" tab. They mentioned that it's for big screens like tablets and Android TVs _  I think it's true  because of such small buttons that it has which may go out of touch with phones. It has a very nice UI and it's totally free without add which keeps me in it. Though some glitches are here and there like add-ons are not getting installed _  but can not expect more from a free app. Keep working on it please.,3,02/01/2017,12
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Before this "new update" i was able to watch kodi on my Samsung galaxy 6 _  now it doesn't even show music _  exodus _  phoenix _  none of it!! Tf is going on?!?! I need an explanation of this asap!! This doesn't make any sense to have this app work before then when it updated it doesn't anymore😡😡😡,1,08/15/2016,8
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,This is the most convenient way to get all not-pirated streaming content in one place. When setup properly _  Kodi allows you to browse through not-pirated episodes from a wide variety of networks and streaming services that you're obviously not too cheap to pay for. Contrary to what many people say _  it really sucks as a media player _  since the interface is archaic and confusing. It's main use _  as far as I am aware _  is to enable the watching of not-pirated content.,5,08/02/2016,5
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I do love this app but I gave it one star in the hope of someone from kodi to see this. My Bluetooth headphones do not work with it I get no sound. I still get sound from other apps just not kodi. I've seen some forums onlone from last year saying the same prolem. Please fix this I would love to give this app 5 stars.,1,09/23/2016,3
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,The audio works through my headphones but not directly through the speaker in my phone anymore for some odd unknown reason. I've tried to look up a solution but so far have come up empty handed. Other than that Kodi is my favorite app.,5,08/15/2016,5
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,This version (17) is just an awful mess. Non of my favourite skins work on it. Uninstalled and I'll use v16 till you fix this. No one asked you to do this. For your UX designer - get your head out your ass and learn UX design 101. Gradually change the interface. You have the luck that this is the only app that works well with streaming add-ons or you would lost now 80% of user base.,1,03/28/2017,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Might seem a bit dull _  complex and daunting to a newbie but get on the YouTube tutorials to get you underway. The Kodi community is evolving all the time. There are some brilliant builds out there now that can bring you endless _  amazing content in a matter of minutes. Massive thank you to Kodi and all the devs.,5,01/09/2017,51
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I use to love Kodi until they discontinued installing more than one addon per link to use. Now each link you use only works for one addon at a time _  which makes it way more time consuming. It was way better before when you did much less work in long run. Plus it takes a little too much space in my phone _  so not the thing for me anymore. You pretty much lost this customer unless ya'll change that _  which I full heartedly doubt.,2,07/14/2019,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,life channels dont work with kodi 17. Very slow . When u click on a cheannel it says fetching stream and it plays it ans when you press the back key on remote _  instead of bringing the channel list it will reload all channels and will say fetching streams again. Very slow,1,02/04/2017,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,This is a fantastic app with great open ended viewing opportunities with a little dedication and research you could be watching all the latest content you want. There are countless YouTube tutorials and websites dedicated to informing you of how to install latest builds and addons etc... so instead of complaining it's not updating and being spoonfed your content go seek it out I personally use the paradox build and if you google that all information is online only last night was I watching the latest movies,5,06/12/2016,48
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,You can load any build you want _  and access any video on the planet.  But the video quality for any live event is junk.  Okay to good _  for recorded things.  Live sports video is complete junk _  and drops audio _  but commercials come through fine.  At least I don't miss my games _  and it's 100% Free.  Even with my disgruntlement about the live video _  I still suggest it to anybody looking for a streaming app.  If they could fix the live feed quality _  I'd be in love.,4,10/29/2016,3
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I love this app.  It have its ups and downs _  but it's FREE!  People that are compiling go and buy cable service!  If you're getting something this priceless free you have to deal with the good and the bad!  You're not the one providing the sources for others like yourself to take advantage of.  Learn a different way to download your favorite shows and movies!  I've been using XBMC since it was on xBox _  and I installed it on my Apple TV!,5,05/22/2016,13
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I have had to do several updates with this app (great app love it) but my problem is that THIS company needs to put out an updated manual for clean installations and configurations for EACH release. I have noticed that with Jarvis it won't install with Exodus and or 1Channel. Please look into this and make this easy and user friendly for people (beginners or advanced) to do a quick and easy install and configuration,3,06/21/2016,13
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Been using Kodi for years now and to honest I need it in my life now as much as a mobile phone or other little things which have taken over our lives.  I recommend Top tutorials and also Joe nobody's YouTube channels for up to date info..,5,09/07/2016,2
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I used to love Kodi but I feel like something changed. The only videos that will play without transcoding or whatever are in the Bravo TV add on... I used to watch all my TV shows in 1Channel and maybe a couple of the links wouldn't work for Chromecast but now EVERY ONE won't work. What happened??,2,12/19/2016,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Supposedly you can watch movies _  new releases and still ikn the theater on this. But I couldn't find anything new. All I found was OLD movies _  like the ones my great grandparents would've watched. It doesn't let me watch regular tv shows either. This is a waste of space and time. Uninstalling this crap.,1,09/05/2016,5
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,By far _  the Kodi app has been my best experience with viewing content online. The UI is the same as you would get on a laptop. So _  the buttons on the keyboard tend to get a little small for people with "fat fingers". But a very good at experience overall.,5,10/25/2016,3
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I use Kodi on a variety of devices _  and it works great _  but this app for Android refuses to stream correctly anymore.  When I select a stream to view _  it shows the "working" icon trying to load for about a half second _  then stops.  What can I do to fix this?  If you can resolve this _  I will adjust my rating.,2,09/26/2016,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I went on Kodi today and realized that the Genesis part on MOVIE doesn't work anymore..... I used Genesis for everything I watched.. and now it stops working..

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I am not given the option for movies. The app just looks like something you have to download files onto in order for you to do anything. Please help me understand why I can not experience what others are experiencing and enjoying!!,1,08/23/2016,7
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,There should be something to watch over the download progress NEW TOOLS AND OPTIONS SHOULD BE ADDED as for example that download manager one and the streaming layout should be improved i.e video player other than that its the best movie streaming app "TOO GOOD",3,12/30/2016,0

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I love this app. When the days are long and boring _  I can get some excitement with my kodi. It allows you to actually do away with those high cable bills _  ant it's free...say no more..,5,10/30/2016,1

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,OMFG _  this app decides video faster and smoother than VLC and MX Player! How does it do this black magic? Plus _  it doesn't even buffer on my unstable internet. I swear this app was made by gods...,5,07/10/2016,5
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Just the best piece of free software around for movies _  tv shows and music _  you don't need a degree in technology to use it and it's always being improved. I'm running it on an Android TV and it's opened up so much free content just follow tutorials on YouTube and enjoy. Thanks to all at KODI _  remember these guys and girls built this thing and give it to us for FREE.,5,02/02/2017,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,At last a media player that does what you want it to do; 1. play media from your NAS drive _  2. easy access to online media services (YouTube _  iPlayer _  Radio _  live sports) _  3. Games _  and much more. Only issue so far is no option for multi room broadcasting. Keep up the good work.,5,07/09/2016,16
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Kodi is not very user friendly. So i think the people who gave this app a bad rating either dont know how to use it or just have not installed the right plug-ins to fit their taste. There are thousands of plug-ins. You just have to find the ones that will fulfill what you want. Kodi has more streams available than any other app. Also if youre streaming movies/tv shows its very important which streaming source website you select to avoid buffering issues. Learn how to use it and you'll love it!,5,06/15/2016,6
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Kodi will not open for me on my phone since the update. It shows a black screen and then closes out. And ideas on how to fix this problem? Still works great on my firestick!,3,07/06/2016,8

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,First of all I want to state kodi is a media player only. Your problems with watching movies is not kodi but the 3rd party apps that you are using in kodi to watch movies. If you want to watch just movies and tv shows with out trying to figure out how to add those apps just go to terrarium tv download it and mx player to play it and you won't have any problems. I just read where some guy was mad cause he was not able to hear some cam video well cause it's in theatre. Stop blaming Kodi plus it's free.,5,10/06/2016,4

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,There is no competent for this app. Just AWESOME.  and I'm curious if you have any plan to support VR mode? If Kodi supports VR mode (head tracking google card board mode) _  this will rule! Would you add 180/360 VR mode _  please?,5,07/19/2016,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,The updated version buffers like forever. Hope they can fix this. Still i give it 4 stars. It helped me relieved boredom when we were waiting for our flight which was late for like 8hrs.,4,06/30/2016,3

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Great app once you figure it out _  or you look it up online for step by steps directions _  which even then can be slightly confusing.

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,The app design is great but video streamings for live sports like Sky Sports does not work good. It stops and hae to restart the video streaming. How cN someone expect to enjoy the streamings when you have to restart the video every 2 minutes. Same for pc!! FIX IT OR ABORT IT! NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR LIVE STEAMING!!!!!,1,08/21/2016,2
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,When ever you have to do a factory reboot because of to much clutter or outdated info that's difficult to delete AND OR need the latest  Kodi firmware get this app it is the easiest way to install it without having to download a .apk file and format it to use on your device or system. I recommend that if you are testing different builds or repositories after you decide which is the best build for you _  do a fresh clean install of kodi for the best experience. You must uninstall it then reinstall it and you will be all set FOR THE BEST POSSIBLE RESULTS.,5,05/24/2016,11

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,In the end of it _  this does not effect the box office. This does allow the unfortunate a much better way to see the movies/music they do not have access to. I _  myself pay for satellite _  data and premium channels _  but this assists in lost/no acess to shows I did not nor cannot record or forgot to record due to having too many shows at the same time!

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I use Kodi on a Samsung Tab S2 which has a 4:3 aspect ratio. Due to this everything on my screen seems to be compressed. At first this did not bother me that much but I can't get over it. Is there a fix for this so my videos _  images _  menus and text aren't squished together as they are now? Also _  I can't seem to find Eminence which is my preferred skin on Kodi.,4,12/18/2016,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Installed and on opening _   took over the whole screen and then became unresponsive.  As it had taken over the whole screen _   could not close it.  No app should take over the whole screen by default for that very reason.,1,09/05/2016,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Excellent app. This app will show/play what you what. It does take time to setup. Unless you use a wizard to install everything. The quality of the movies/sound has nothing to do with the app _  it depends on the source that it is coming from. Highly recommended multimedia app.,5,09/22/2016,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Great app  _  but one of the TV links stopped working  _  and Kodi has an annoying pop-up that makes noise every 5 Seconds alerting you the invalid connect.

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Everything about kodi is great. I only wish it would allow integration of the device's keyboard. I dont peticularly like the small keyboard that is difficult to use for people with large hands or fingers. It is also a pain to use for my firestick. Please upgrade the keyboard or allow the device's stock keyboard to be default.,5,06/15/2016,427
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I use this app every night _  I have it on 2 tablets a pc and a tv _  but on the tablet every 2-3 weeks it seems to crash and I have to reinstall it to make it work _  is this a bug that is known about?,5,06/24/2016,2

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Terrible. At least a few basic English  instructions might help _  you bunch of gimps. Totally uninstalled along with the Kodi firestick which I threw away. It seems as though _  unless you have a degree in PC and software _  you get sod all out of this.,1,01/21/2017,0

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,All of a sudden I cannot open Kodi in my galaxy tab. So when I reinstalled it   is still not working. I then installed it to my Lg and when I'm about to install an add-on it goes black....again.,1,01/11/2017,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I love how everyone swears by this app.. Its utter bullcrap! Nothing ever works on it _  its fails to load / play streams constantly. Worst most overrated app ever! Would be great... If any of it worked!!!,1,07/25/2016,3
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Like it _  but have trouble mirroring to my television. I know I did it correctly because it was working and then mysteriously stopped. I haven't been able to get it working again since. Although it is an issue with my tablet _  not the app _  it still degrades my overall experience.,4,04/27/2016,5
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,One of the best apps for finding free streaming video content out there. I have installed the Exodus _  1channel _  VideoDevil and Ultimate Whitecream add-ons and have every video content imaginable on my fingertips (you can find instructions on how to install those add-ons by Googling). Also _  the opensubtitles add-on rocks.    It also plays local content _  but you have to add your internal storage (listed as external for some reason) manually as a source.  PS: If you have a MediaTek device and get black screen on some videos _  try disabling hardware acceleration.,5,07/23/2016,6

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,So hilarious reading all the negative reviews about the skin - you lot do realise there is more to this update than just a front-end right? Right? Probably not.

Keep up the great work guys _  love it.,5,02/02/2017,0

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Xbox Media Player _  (or XBMP for short) _  now obsolete _  was the predecessor to XBMC and XBMC4Xbox _  a feature-rich free and open sourcemedia player for the Xbox (console). With an audio/video-player-core based on MPlayer _  it allowed owners of a modified Xbox to display pictures and movie files _  as well as play music files from the Xbox DVD-ROM drive _  built-in harddisk drive _  LAN (SMB) or the Internet... Only Complaint: Kodi could use some stylus support now that is on Android though.,4,01/11/2017,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Great player. Easy to use and I like being able to stream my movies from my laptop to my phone. One downfall is when I pause the movie and my phone shuts off _  I have to restart the movie when I want to start watching it again. That needs to be fixed. 4/5 stars,4,08/13/2016,16
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,It is awesome I honestly love it. It's easy to use. The only thing is that is that you have to download "Exodus" in the beginning and sometimes the picture isn't very clear other than that it's is great!!! It is an amazing app...,5,09/05/2016,13

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Everything works after setting up _  does everything pretty smoothly on my S7 _  but for some reason everytime I open Kodi it thinks it's my first time. So I get all the annoying pop ups that comes with first starting Kodi everytime I want to use it. Other than that it's fantastic.,4,09/05/2016,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Once you can figure this app out it is fantastic. The problem is it is very hard to figure out how to use it. I suggest using YouTube and Google to your advantage to figure this app out. I've done searches for the last 2 months. I figured out a lot but I have a long way to go still a lot I don't understand. If you want to know if you can add on something specific just ask YouTube and you'll get a step by step video. I suggest installing "Fusion". It has the most important add ons in fused together in one st,4,04/28/2016,3

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Yeah it works better on box than mobile device but that's a small gripe. Does an amazing overall job when configured with the best addons.Most negative comments  seem to be from people too lazy _  dumb or stubborn to make an effort to try to correctly utilize it. " No stream available" isn't a problem with the app _  genius!,5,05/14/2016,18

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I use it all the time and reccomend it to everyone. Beside a few buffering issues _  right now my only issue is that the  'in theaters' section is currently showing the exact same as what is in 'new movies'. If it wasn't for that I would give it 5 stars,4,09/06/2016,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,V17 = 0 stars _  v16 = 5 stars. Downgraded to v17 smh...almost impossible to select anything from a list in v17. Lists keep scrolling on their own _  never selects what I touched.  Super frustrating _  the new ui looks neat and cleaner _  but just does NOT work for me. Slower and a total pita to use. Upgraded back down to v16 _  much better. Don't bother with v17 unless you want to be constantly annoyed,4,02/11/2017,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,The program doesn't respond sometimes. Also the icons are too small. This is  still the best media player I can find.,4,08/03/2016,8

Gladly I have other devices which can handle it or haven't updated (Linux on an XP computer is fine _  but marshmallow doesn't cope) get it fixed please.

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,The streams and the content are great _  but the software is buggy. No error handling for busy or unavailable streams _  no user feedback for glitchy streams (e.g. I had jittery streams _  which turned out to be lack of video memory _  but could equally have been buffering). Frequently loads the wrong menus _  making content inaccessible _  requiring a restart.,2,09/09/2016,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Tbh _  if messing around for 20 mins just to make one link work is what you are looking for then great but everything I try to watch either skips every second with sound or just doesn't work. Don't waste your time _  you are better off paying for these programmes/movies directly and legally. That's just the start though _  the interface of the app is the most unresponsive I've ever used _  the homepage is fine but it takes an eternity for me to select something to watch as it will not select anything.,1,08/19/2016,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,So far I like this software of all I've sampled. I like Plex & emby too _  but this is great as watching a movie _  just messin' around with the configurations and whatnot.

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Functionally _  it seems to play all video formats. But the user interface is something only tech heads will understand--nobody in the house except myself is able to navigate through to the DLNA server on the network _  or figure out how to get to the streaming services. And even I get frustrated by the many clicks needed to play a video. Move or click something the wrong way while playing a video _  and menus fly open.  Terrible interface. I have far better on other devices in the house. Not recommended by any means.,2,01/25/2017,0

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Upgraded to my Samsung Galaxy S4 previously from the S4. On my S4 _  Kodi worked a dream. Everything worked fine _  addons worked and could install everything I needed without any trouble. Now using my S7 _  nothing don't install without a profile login. (I have a profile _  it just don't log it in for me). Any add on I try to use _  won't launch without a profile. Nothing will connect to the server anymore. Just awful _  uninstalled now!,1,11/27/2016,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I use this as a central media centre on my Android laptop and will be looking at using elswehere. It's ability to use usermade addons means I can circumvent problems made by companies chosing to lock out certain platforms despite me paying for their content. Cheers guys!,5,05/08/2016,2
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,App runs phenomenally well on S5 _  32gb class 10 SD Card _  ZeR0 problems... Thanks Kodi you Rock!,5,08/28/2016,2
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Horrible _  horrible _  horrible update! What possessed you to create kodi 17? It's a nightmare to navigate and to install repositories unlike version 16. You have truly screwed up if this is your idea of a new interface.  I've reinstalled jarvis and disabled updates to avoid looking at the garbage that is Krypton!,1,04/27/2017,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I do love this app. Not too keen of beta version. It seems to be too tedious to try to put add-ons installed.,5,01/13/2017,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I'd give it 5 stars because I absolutely LOVE this app but it's not opening for me now which is very weird as this app usually runs very smoothly. Please help me trouble shoot 😭,4,01/22/2017,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,There is even no menu movie _  for the other things it said error error error everywhere. Removed after 5 minutes,1,04/28/2016,1

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Best app I have ever downloaded.  Saves me pounds every month. Just a little fiddly setting it up _  so ask a six year old to set it up for you..never need sky again.,5,12/01/2016,0

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Just changed phone and several apps won't download.  This included.  Gets to 23.59mb download then Google play shuts down. No error or dialogue _   not nothing! Anyone any ideas? Usually happens with large apps e.g games.  Seems to happen in the same place too. Every single time. This is a great app by the way.  Just wish I could install it😡,5,10/06/2016,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I have addons and none of them work well or are constantly loading and do not understand when I make a selection. Half the shows on any thing do not work and buttons are way too small to press.,2,07/08/2016,2
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Would of given it 4.5 stars but there's always room for improvement (and I couldn't figure out how to give it the .5). You need to watch a lot of YouTube videos for tutorials _  but well worth it. Would be nice if you could report bad links or wrong links to something that have nothing to do with what you wanted to watch _  or maybe there is and I just haven't found it yet.,4,10/25/2016,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Not working...  Doesn't load basic skin.  Just greyish screen..   Using a Xperia m4 aqua. Used it before with no issues.  This update seems to say a big no!,1,07/13/2016,7

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Easy to use. No better on demand movie or tv show selection out there. If you cant find what you are looking for on here than it doesnt exist or you need to have someone show you how to use it. I recommend using with a vpn.,5,11/30/2016,40
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Aside from it not auto pausing when you exit out _  and resuming when you open it back up _  it's not bad. Although it would be great if they could add that feature.,4,11/28/2016,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I agree with previous person _  if anyone gives this app less than 5 stars u either need to get a box and not use your phone or get the right apps within kodi like EXODUS _  VELOCITY _  PHOENIX _  fights theres plenty just gotta research the site a little cause to complain about this is like complaining if u had an app to get free phone service.  C0me on people research your apps.  visit website _  get real debrid _  cheap and less buffering.  Gotta know what your talking about before rating.  Big shoutouts to all that put their time and efford into these apps within this app as well as  kodi _  you guys Rock😀!!,5,05/14/2016,52
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Best app. I've a little problem though _  when I get a phone call whole kodi is playing _  the playback paused during the ringing but as soon I answer the call _  kiddo resumes playback and I got both sounds at the speakers.,5,08/11/2016,2

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Great app! Just kinda sad that all the buttons are so small _  it happens so often that I want to pause something and I accidentally click something else so it restarts the video.. But perfect otherwise!,5,05/09/2016,4
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I use it all the time _  love to watch movies on it.... but every once and a while the app stops working _  and I have to uninstall then re-install it... it can get really annoying! Plz fix and I will give 5 star😃😃😃😃😃,4,08/07/2016,0

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,The buttons are so small it's almost impossible for me to click the right one on my galaxy s7. It would be nice to have options come up in a scroll list at least. Also the smart Playlist does not seem to work at all. I've tried everything I can think of but _  it won't scan the folder I point it to or populate the list in any way. It will read from the SD card but _  won't add any videos the playlists or the main screen.,2,12/22/2016,0

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Very cool app... Can find anything! Only criticism is that not all streams playback. Sometimes takes several tries before I find one that works.,4,11/17/2016,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Completely unintelligible to me _  even though I am a computer programmer. What does PROGRAMS mean? I tried to watch DVB-IPTV with it and could not see anything _  because there was no such choice. Stealing my time. Uninstalled.,1,09/05/2016,1

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I ordered a G-box xmbc and had to install Kodi onto it. I can watch all the new movies n everything. It does get really frustrating cuz it seems like it's always changing or needs updating and the buffering can get on your nerves. It's many different apps you can add if you YouTube it. Once you've done all that all the work it took to get it is so worth it. Idk if it's different from a tablet or G box but the g box is wayyy better.,4,06/29/2016,0

Nice app. I give 5 star,5,05/13/2016,6
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,It works well and has a decent UI _  though important features like buffering and cache control are only accessible by manually editing config files which is annoying on Android. Also _  just like the desktop version _  it has trouble exiting and almost always freezes while doing so _  resulting in lost settings changes.,3,08/12/2016,0

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,This app is so good that I believe it deserves a lot of money. This app is a million dollar app you can use to watch all movies and tv shows FOR FREE.

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,1. Keep it running in the background like netflix so you can continue watching where you left off 2. Make the video playback full screen 3. Double tapping screen makes the menu bar at the bottom go away during video playback 4.make app more android friendly and finally actually update the app unlike alot of other crappy devs out there and for the love of god make the writing bigger this should be common sense.,2,06/14/2016,7

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,It is without a doubt the best media management app out there. With its countless add-ons and out-of-the-box features there is nothing better out there.  Surprisingly in many occasions there has been videos this app managed to play where VLC failed.,5,12/08/2016,0

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Dropped my previous rating by 2 stars because of system requirement changes.  This is a good example of why Playstore automatic updates should be disabled _  (wish that it could be done app by app).  We like Kodi 16 Jarvis _  but we won't make the major version upgrade (not update) _   to 17.  Some family devices are not supported by 17 _  and can't be updated or won't be replaced. Setting up every device for the legally accessible live streaming sources is  bad enough without needing to support two different app versions. I understand why the developer feels pressured to make changes _  I wish the video pirates would use something else.,3,02/04/2017,6
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,It used to work fine _  on exodus the menu screens would pop up and most things were holdable for movies _  for example _  to turn on subtitles or whatever _  now I can't hold any option or even get media controls.,2,09/25/2016,0

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I've been using kodi since 2011. It is one of the best streaming applications hands down. Its only drawback is at any given time some of the add ons stop working.,4,05/10/2016,3
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I like this app. Best option to watch your fave movies _ sports and TV shows on the go and at home.my only thing is now the addons shortcut won't save on the home screen.,5,09/22/2016,2

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Everything you have in the desktop version _  is here on Android. Pretty good and pretty fast. The only drawback is the default skin _  which is a little hard to configure at the beginning,4,07/31/2016,2
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Before I did an update on my phone it used to be great (hence 4 stars) but since I've now updated it keeps cutting off every 10-15 mins _  not sure if kodi needs to play catch up,4,12/27/2016,0

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Been a fan of xbmc since way back in the days of the original Xbox. The Kodi team do some amazing things. I love the way Krypton is looking _  and can't wait for its official release.,5,10/15/2016,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I'm very happy that kodi finally released the android version on to the playstore. I've personally been using third party apps _  with their own versions which have charged a nominal fee which is fair enough but very limited build wise _  some have just ripped individuals of charging a fortune for what majority wise is built by others and maintained. Now the official kodi is on here with it's many optional builds to boot _  it will see the cowboys of with charging to much for what is essentially free. I do not include the AVstream app in this _  for which it has served my purpose very well until kodi has finally arrived _  so it's time to say goodbye to it. To add _  i have been looking within the app to donate some cash _  if the feature is there it is difficult to find _  I would suggest making a donate feature prominent as it's within everyone's interest to keep this maintained and running and show appreciation for the hard work put in by them.,5,08/02/2016,2
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,new version is awful. default skin changed without my permission and 4:3 is incorrectly scaled. very slow ui on x265 files. do not use the latest version. 16.1 works perfectly. use this version.,1,02/15/2017,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Worked fine initially _  but 3 days later it's still serving stale file listings via DLNA no matter what I do. Updating the library has no effect. Clearing the cache either. The smart folder contents are updating _  so it's clearly doing something. Asking on the forums got nothing more than a "lol we cache more now" with no suggestions on resolving my problem. A media center that can't even tell me what media is present is useless.,2,11/25/2016,0

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I still have an original Xbox _  the big chunky thing _  it runs a fairly current build of XBMC proper _  maintained by a crazy German. Even some of the plugins work. However _  the most amazing thing about the software is media support. If you have an mkv encoded stream in a gzipoed ISO. XBNC/Kodi won't care _  it will just play it. Basic VOB files and a text file containing time code subtitles _  it'll play that too. On a network attached storage over wi-fi _  no problem. Truly it is the universal can opener. Amazing.,5,01/01/2017,0

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Too many steps to get to what you want: Every time i want to play music _  i have to chose it _  go to the directory _  go to the sub-directories _  ect. In Plex _  you just TELL it where you music is and BAM _  you NEVER have to navigate anything again outside of pressing "music". Same with movies _  ect.  Kodi (aka XBMC) was a great idea back in the "Original" Xbox days _  when other (better) free apps didn't exist. But let's be real about this app _  it's an out-dated concept with a bunch of (most of the time) POINTLESS _  cheezy _  plug-ins to make it look "cool" to people.   Half of the time _  it doesn't work correctly with SMB (Samba) or other file systems and refuses to see all the systems / directories and nobody wants that hassle anymore but Linux "dreamers" who keep hoping that Linux (for all it's open-source freedom) is going to ever be better than Windows.   This is a whole lot of code for a very little final product. This app needs to retire and let other apps (which are obviously easier / hassle-free to operate) take the reigns and continue down the road.  In it's current line of formatting _  will NEVER reach the same standards most other non-Linux apps already have mastered.,2,11/18/2016,0

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Upgraded from 3 to 5 stars. At first _  Kodi always crashed on my SkyStream X X4 (Android 4.4.2 _  rooted) when a text field was opened _  as when searching for a video. Two video add-ons could not be found in the add-on list and there is no way to sort that list into Enabled-Disabled-Other.  With some effort and NO help from SkyStream technical support _  I was able to edit the video add-on list and set the background to solid black (I made a black image with a photo editor) and I can now see what I am doing. I am now pleased with Kodi.  (Incidentally _  if you are plagued with SkyStream difficulty _  get and use the Nova Launcher _  here on Google Play. I used my solid-black image as a background and no longer have to put up with the bull***t of an uneditable Favorites list and the 0-to-11 hours on the 12-hour clock instead of the universal 1-to-12 hour clock. This comment is not relevant to the Kodi app.),5,10/19/2016,1

Stay away from 17 for now _  in my opinion _  its slow _  desponds s!ow _   non-intuitive _  menus in places with no sense  the 15/16 design decisions kept a style for easy transition and was extremely fast and responsive _  but to compare the last 3 versions  _  15 was like WinXP _  16 like Win7 _  17 like Win 10.

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,People asking for exodus are idiots who can't use Google to find out about it and why the kodi team has and wants nothing to do with it _  even though it can still be used and installed IF YOU REALLY WANTED IT FOR SOME REASON AND LEARNED TO USE A SEARCH ENGINE TO FIND IT. PLEASE STOP GOING ON ABOUT IT AS IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE FUNCTIONING OF THIS SOFTWARE.  16.1 is great software for using to organise and view media files _  but keyboards become tiny on phones. Definitely aimed more at tablet devices.  17 versions have been awful for doing anything. Multiple add-ons I used were incompatible with - which in itself I can forgive as many developers may not have time to work on a single obscure podcast feed and get it working on new software _  for instance - but rediscovering the UI is infuriating and trying to select menu items even more so. Version 16 _  however _  remains solid.,2,09/24/2017,0

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,#TeamBlackberry give us a 1:1 screen ratio option Kodi please - posted from my gorgeous Blackberry Passport BB10 device! We would rather use Kodi over SPMC! Kalemsoft _  google it guys it's superior as of now but not well known _  they even have a option for a 1:1 ratio that does near perfect job filling the entire screen however Kodi is a five star app!..,5,03/21/2016,28
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Without a doubt _  this is the must have for anyone on the planet with average Internet connection!! Not only you already have a huge variety of content but additional option like language and subtitles are available also. I truly thank the devs for all hard work _  effort and time to make this possible anyone on any platform out there. It's been a decade already and still rocking !!! Keep it up Guys 🎬,5,02/22/2016,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,You won't be disappointed! For those who are sick of Netflix and searching online for what to watch with popups. Its time to use an app that has everything you can think of and more! I love it. Its also faster with no popups as suppose to looking up shows or movies via search engines. Absolutely incredible thank you for such an awesome app.,5,03/23/2016,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Using Kodi is super easy especially when you set it up with tvaddons config-wiz (known as Fusion and it's free). There is a app on the store called configurator _  stay away from it as they charge you a lot of money for something that is free elsewhere. I have been using this app for over a year now and can honestly say that this is by far the best media player around. Keep up the great work. The only thing that you have to do is make sure you keep an eye on what sources are still active.,5,03/06/2016,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Took a chance and downloaded _  not expecting much. But I can find _  stream and download just about any video imaginable. The best thing I've found on the Play Store in years. So easy to use it's like child's play.,5,03/27/2016,6
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,People are rating this 1* due to the upgrade to 16.0 Jarvis. The only reason they're having compatability issues is because they're expecting their Isengard builds to work out-the-box on Jarvis. WAIT FOR DEVELOPERS TO UPDATE THEIR BUILDS OR INSTALL A COMPATIBLE BUILD! Kodi is amazing when you know what you're doing with it. Keep up the good work! Jarvis feels a lot smoother _  faster and more reliable!,5,02/29/2016,12
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Love this app _  have the MyGica box also (which is currently working) and have been using it for about a year now. Just yesterday _  the app stopped opening on my phone.. I got to the loading page and then it goes to a dark grey page and never opens any further than that. Any reason that may be happening?,4,03/14/2016,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Pro's Updates itself & Ever a problem you can call them and they'll fixi and have make on working. Overall it's a good Streaming Device & its an Android Devices Definitely.. So I'm sure this is also good. I've been waiting for Google Play Store to have it..Finally got it.Excited to Browse through. Thank you,5,04/20/2016,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,By far one of the best media organizers in the planet.  I even use it to watch TV!! How awesome is that?... Thanks to the Kodi team for such a wonderful product.  I will be donating for sure!  A positive review is just not enough!,5,04/22/2016,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Find at times it lags... but with it working well more often than not..I will say excellent. It gives video quality HQ LQ etc. Take ur pic. But I have to give it 5 stars I love the app.. check it out. U won't b disappointed. 😉,5,04/16/2016,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,most of  the people that knock kodi is because they are not using it as intended. the builds and addons are by third party developers and has nothing to do with the kodi community. so please stop giving bad ratings because your addon or build no longer works with the new update.,5,02/27/2016,5
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Using KODI will definitely upgrade your life. This is a fact. It's like having a backstage pass to the entire body of work known to man. It's like having X-Ray goggles with interchangeable telescopic/microscopic lenses. Abuse it at your own peril. With great power comes great responsibility. Be good now. Go see EVERYTHING _  so that wisdom may visit you someday _  even if only by random luck. God bless you.,5,03/03/2016,4
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,This is by far the best app I've used in years _  as far as anything to do with movies/shows. I have this app installed in my firestick and it works flawlessly! Very pleased with it _  so I was very excited when I saw I can have it on my phone _  there's only one problem and I hope I can get help with this or pointed to the right direction. On my firestick it has a add on app called ****** to stream movies which is the main app I use _  and I just can't find it on here _  what am I doing wrong?,5,02/27/2016,7
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Like all things _  you get out of this what you put in.  And this package is certainly worth the effort.  It works and has a fantastic support network behind it.  It's a great shame that everyman on the street will thumb their nose at it _  because it's not been coupled to a high-end brand name device.  Love it.  :-),5,03/04/2016,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I have been using this since I learned how to softmod my Xbox _  such an amazing media center. It just keeps growing and getting better and better. Keep up the great work XBMC Foundation!,5,03/03/2016,4
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Who designed this trash? Microsoft? Everything is small _  hard to click on _  and counterintuitive. Installing plugins is an absolute nightmare _  and everything is way too broad with not being able to incorporated different plugins with one another. The app used to perform well  but now it crashes all the time _  and it's infuriating. Thanks so much for wasting my time with this app.,1,03/10/2016,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Can't get any better than this. Works flawlessly with smart TV _  Mac _  windows _  other phones and tablets _  anything on the networks _  streams video from all over the world! And how much free porn can one ever wish to have? Not to mention the movies and binge watching endless seasons of any TV show.  Netflix _  ha! Cords _  nevermore!,5,04/13/2016,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Excellent source of entertainment. Quality program. User interface is complicated and time consuming if not impossible for novice users. For those having a good grip on computer technology _  be prepared to spend hours making it work as you want. It could be a fun hobby. I'm sure they are doing their best to make it easy and due to the enormous amount of media out there and different platforms being used _  they are doing quite well!,4,04/14/2016,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,App worked beautifully before the Jarvis update... Now it runs slow and lags tremendously _  icons blend in with background now so it's hard to see what your clicking on or what it's trying to load on Genesis _  and video player option bar is not visible anymore so I can't pause stop or rewind/fast forward _  please fix so I can enjoy my shows again _  will rate 5 when app is functioning properly again,1,02/22/2016,52
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Worked great at one time. After update and even unstalling and installing again it is not working at the five star level it once did. In the Exodus movie I'm only able to click most popular and featured and maybe one other. Will you please fix.,2,02/23/2016,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I have used Kodi across all platforms and I love it. I have it installed in windows 8.1 _  raspberry pi 2 _  and my phones and tablets. Just configure with fusion wizard and your set. Update 03/08/16 latest  kodi leaves much to b desired  _  sporadic crashes on android 4.4 with frequent restarts with less than 55% battery,3,03/09/2016,34
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,This update has destroyed kodi on my dragon touch tablet. All txt is unreadable and shows as blocks. Even a reinstall has not fixed it. Please roll back previous version this is a terrible update! Was 5 stars all the way before this!,1,02/26/2016,3
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Love that it's easy to use _  huge selection of movies and TV shows. I can enjoy movies that are still in theaters in the comfort of my home by casting to my TV. The picture quality is extremely good even in HQ and MQ. I never run into problems with the movie freezing up or having other problems. I would recommend Kodi to everyone!,5,02/21/2016,85
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,As I open kodi it starts updating add ons and will freeze. Every time without fail. I have to force close it twice and usually works on the 3rd attempt. Annoying why was this changed from the previous version? Love it apart from this will change rating when fixed,4,02/21/2016,543
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Great app to manage watching local files etc. However _  upscaling via the Nvidia Shield doesn't really work. My old Boxee without Kodi outputs much better graphics. Please give a "manual" option to choose upscaling algorithms.,3,04/16/2016,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,It's abysmal that reading the reviews people think that the pirated movie and tv add ons are part of kodi. They're not. "Fix the movie app"or "I can't watch anything since update".  Even the good reviews are thanking kodi for the pirated 3rd party add-ons. Lol _  it has nothing to do with kodi. The app is great by itself _  what you can do with it is AMAZING. like watch third party add-ons...That don't belong to kodi..,5,03/02/2016,10
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I am so grateful to all the people that work on and continue to develop this program. I cannot afford cable and internet and thanks to kodi _  I don't have to waste my money. I am a dedicated fan _  and will continue to spread the good word!! Thank you all!!!,5,02/22/2016,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I've been using this player for as long as i can remember to watch files from my nas on widows pc with xbmc installed _  then Ubuntu with xbmc installed _  then openelec xbmc _  openelec kodi on a nettop _  most recently kodi on amazon fire tv and now on my LG G5. I never expected the movies to play so well over wireless on my phone but they do _  very happy with that. Only one thing _  when i want to use the exit button it doesn't other than that flawless! Great work devs ;),5,04/17/2016,18
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Kodi used to be better but now 2 movies i want to see will not play and the streaming has become stop and go. If its not fixed soon i will just go back to cable service. Please fix dirty grandpa and daddys home.,5,02/28/2016,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I try to configure with wizard but it gives me an error and says check your log for more information. One 1 channel there are 0 items that come up no movies or TV series. Also others like Genesis does the same and if movies do come up im given an error to check my log again. I know its 16.0 Jarvis version but its just not working and im really disappointed because I know how good this app this _  please help me. Thank you.,4,02/27/2016,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Was perfect _  now broken. 16.0 update ruined the app for me. Don't really feel like trying to fiddle with it everyday considering none of the links work for me now so I'll just delete it. I don't know why they updated to begin with but it made the app completely unusable (for me _  at least),1,02/28/2016,31
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,The app has a very nice interface and is pretty easy to control. Problem is that the buttons in the sidebar immediately react when the sidebar is being pulled. This results in me performing unwanted actions like adding a playlist or starting/stopping music. (Samsung Galaxy Tab 2),2,04/07/2016,34
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I only use this as a media player to stream my music collection. No issues  ---- until I had to rescan my music and it kept missing albums. Not consistent  ---- on different scans either. Rolled back to jarvis...no issues at all. Not a  ---- good update.,2,05/17/2018,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Since Jarvis _  when i start a video or ffw/rewind with AC3 or DTS _  the amp is doing something weird and i go through a source detection/black screen. when the audi is just stereo _  it is not doing this. Isengard was much better,3,02/27/2016,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,It was working great _  and I have had it for a long time _  now I cant even get the search to work _  and if I am lucky enough to find something to watch _  it doesnt play. Cant you put it back to the way it was?,2,02/26/2016,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Since the last update the app doesn't load. The app either crashes and goes back to my home screen or the it goes to a dark screen and just hangs there _   please fix asap. Using a Galaxy Tab 4. Just figured out if you go into app info and delete the cache it will then work.,4,03/15/2016,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,The static is irritating when using my headphones!! The setup was very complicated. Its more difficult to browse through and figure out what to do. I haven't been able to watch any movies _  TV shows or Sports. It keeps saying update has failed or configuration has failed. This sucks. I'll update the app and hopefully everything will work out fine.,5,05/25/2017,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Loved Genesis _  after the update  _  it stopped working please look into that and fix it..no addons seems to be working specially fusion. It kind of useless now..very disappointed.,2,02/22/2016,11

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Crap on my Tab 3 tablet for some reason.  Force closes after 10-15 seconds every time without fail.  Other than that _  every file played on phone has worked _  even large mkv bluray backups _  and all audio played without issue.  Hope it gets fixed for Tab 3 soon.  Kodi will soon be my exclusive media player at this rate.,4,04/14/2016,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,When i put Kodi in background while movie/stream is running and come back to app internal player is killed and it goes back to menu (Htc one m9 _  mm 6.0 _  kodi v. 16). It was working good on 5.1.1 _  kodi v. 15. Tried removing 'doze' mode for Kodi... I know about external player option...,5,02/24/2016,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,If you love your movies _  music and pictures and want to keep them available in one place where you can easily and fluently see and select them then Kodi is a must. I have Kodi controlling my entertainment system _  it has all the features you could possibly need and keeps your collection looking sweet,5,02/20/2016,13

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Love the app _   worked flawlessly on my s6.  Just got a ZE601KL and the app seems to crash occasionally when watching a video or trying to load channels sometimes.  Running stock 5.0.2. Thank you,5,03/24/2016,453
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,One of my favourite apps however it has been bugging a lot recently. Sometimes when I load settings or addons I get black a black screen and when I watch a video the overlay sometimes doesn't work. The overlays /pop-up are often broken and I have not been able to fix it. I have tried reinstalling and clearing cache but still no use. It is a shame that bugs can ruin such a good app. I have used this on PC and never had these problems. Still highly recommend the app though  _ it is simply brilliant.,3,03/01/2016,21
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,This app is perfect. Genesis _  exodus _  prime wire and any other third party apps ARE NOT KODI. KODI ALLOWS YOU TO USE THEM. The bad reviews are unfortunate and are from uninformed users of the app.,5,03/02/2016,2
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,however still in development _  still weak and confused resources _  most interesting streams or tv channels has to be sepparately found and hardly settled,4,03/03/2016,2
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Yes if you are a little tech challenged do your research for those giving ratings under 5 stars. You will not find a better wealth of entertainment for free _  period. Excellent work Kodi developers & addon makers who make it all happen.,5,10/27/2016,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,This app had helped through my depression and fight against my injuries. It gives me joy bc I have access to so much entertainment. THANK YOU,5,03/21/2016,1

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,App fn sucks now. Nothing works properly. All the video feeds or links crash or fail to load. That new exodus link is never updated. This app has become a disappointment. I'm switching back to netflix. Atleast I can watch something. Feels like I have to search and search for 30 min just to find a freaked link that works or something that is updated. This used to be an awesome app. I even recommend and set it up for a bunch of my friends. Idk what happened.,2,03/10/2016,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Video works great still after update. All my addons work still. I just can't for the life of me get any sound no matter what I do. I can't lose the red muted speaker icon.,3,02/22/2016,4
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I go on YouTube and follow how to install builds _  then all.i get is a storage warning and no build. It doesn't say 'Can't install because storage space is low' it says 'some functions may not work as there is low storage on your device! Now I have no storage!,1,03/29/2016,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Used to love kodi up until this update on my android. Lagging home screen and anything I click into sends me to a black screen which doesn't load. Once this issue gets fixed I'll be happy to give 5 stars,1,02/22/2016,2
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,This app is amazing. Been using the PC version for years and now you can get it off the PlayStore without downloading and manually installing. Updates are quick and automatic.,5,02/21/2016,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Ppl giving this any less than 5 stars are clearly dumb. Do a little research before downloading it and figure out how to install add ons. Why pay for Netflix or sports when u can get them for free?,5,03/27/2016,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,this  new update is freezing continuously it doesnt matter what i do to fix it i have to keep going back to home screen and restart sometimes it takes 10 restart for it to work without freeze  you guys really need to work on that issue  im greatful for the app tho thanks,2,04/05/2016,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Steep learning curve to get the most out of it _  but it is very polished and works very well. My only gripe is the audio stops when app is minimized _  I know other apps allow audio to keep going.,5,04/09/2016,3
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Too much effort on pretty ui elements and not enough on making your app tactile. For instance why save errors to a log _  if you can do that then you can pop them on to the error box. No consideration for ux,1,04/09/2016,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Won't play hits me with unplayable streams exodus isn't even on it. So much wrong I prefer to have it on firestick this app keeps freezing,3,03/01/2016,3
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I get the memory cache full buffering error all the time and have tried every fix out there to no avail. I can stream a movie straight through without stops _  but if I so much as pause or rewind/fast forward it becomes impossible to finish the movie. Two stars since it can at least stream straight through.,2,02/20/2016,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,This app let you do so many things. I love the IPTV feature the most. you can use apple TV 4 screensavers too how cool is that.,5,04/06/2016,5
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,If you think you can just downloaded Kodi and watch Movies and TV shows after that _  then you would be wrong. If you want to watch TV Shows and Movies _  I would recommend you use the setup wizard (look it up) or use a build like The Beast or any other build out there. There are plenty of guides out on the Internet to show you how to configure Kodi _  so I would recommend you look some of them up to get started. I hope this helps.,5,04/06/2016,0

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,This new update took away the ability to keep the App running even after pressing the screen off/lock _  which was useful _  if you just wanted to LISTEN to your video stream.  I was able to play a video and turn off the screen and just have the audio. I loved that. Please bring that back!!,1,02/22/2016,18

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,I have used this app since it was known as xbmc but this version does not work for me. It starts first run then closes. I cannot get any further than first run. I have uninstalled and reinstalled many times _  cleared cache and data _  forced close. I have reset my android box and it still wont get past the first screen.,3,03/17/2016,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,People who give this a bad review just don't know how to fully use it. Yes it's a little tricky but it's not rocket science. My only suggestion is that you guys add chromecast capability.,5,03/16/2016,2
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,i don't hate it I had it installed and installed the kewltv/kodi updater app from playstore which i subscribed to _  everything was excellent and would rate 5+stars _  but then kodi updated to jarvis and now i only get a blank screen when i turn kodi on with message kodi not responding.i am not knocking it i think it is a great app _  can anyone help _  thanks.,1,02/27/2016,33
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,This is a great app that does exactly what it claims. It is a fast and easy interface for all your media needs. There are more add ons and customizable  repositorys that the choices can seem daunting.,5,03/11/2016,10
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Worked just fine until the latest update. Now nothing seems to work at all. Search feature doesn't work _  search by year doesn't work _  and so on.,2,02/22/2016,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,This app has the most extensive collection of movies and shows ever.  But the interface is slow and clunky _  text too small _  and no quick way to get to your favorites!  Fixing these things would warrant it 5 Stars.,4,03/30/2016,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Since the latest update if while sreaming video I turn of my screen or press on the home button on my LG G4 Kodi will no longer simply pause it.

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,When you use Kodi on a phone it buffers way too much is useless I have the best internet through spectrum and even when I had Comcast too. Don't waste your time using Kodi on your phone it will buffer alot,2,01/23/2018,0
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Since the release of Jarvis I have had lots of bugs like freezing _  no startup _  different button issues (shield tv) such as menu not coming up _  links stalling or failing to open all together _  and constant buffering on occasion. The only thing that seems to help is clearing app data and starting fresh. Please fix this so I dont have to find another app to stream from my pc. The experience on Isengard was flawless _  maybe it was the recent marshmallow update. Whatever it is it needs to be addressed.,2,03/23/2016,1
App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,For everyone asking for help with third party addons they have nothing to do with third party addons go to third party addons community page on Twitter and Facebook.

Took me a while but found Phoenix _  1channel _  Ccloud _  Pear _  Exodus and some others get almost everything that is available consistently. Install Kodi- google the addon you want- install it or it's repository- watch movies _  TV _  TV shows _  whatever. There is more to it but that will get you going.

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,A seamless install and easy updates.

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Very impressed but disappointed that there is no Chromecast features. Chromecast turns any phone into a mobile media center. When I cast video to my TV I expect to at least have an option to have the screen of my phone be a remote while I see video on the TV. Vlc player can do this. Also I would like to see more support for music visualization plugins.,3,02/26/2016,0

App1089,org.xbmc.kodi,Kodi is a fantastic product. For what it does _  it does well and there isn't much out there to take it on. That said _  after 8 years of using it _  I've moved on to plex with chromecast. In some cases _  plex is weaker in features _  but the simplicity of server client and reliability in function makes it very appealing to family members who aren't as tech savvy.,4,04/24/2016,0
