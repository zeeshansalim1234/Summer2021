App822,org.wordpress.android,Good but there is some issues I have with it 1. The spacing can be annoying when you make a long post it does not goes down it just stays up you have to make it go down. 2. You should be able to edit categories in the app odd you cant. 3. You should be able to change the url for free atleast 1 time sucks you cant. 4. Increase the GB size from 3 to 5.,3,05/14/2020,58
App822,org.wordpress.android,I like the app for the simplicity. Set up is easy and I was writing in minutes. That said _  I'm disappointed that punctuation errors--especially quotation marks--are glitches in the app itself _  not the writer and aren't corrected in published posts. If there's spell check _  I can't find it.,4,06/02/2020,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,Wordpress was listed as the best blogging platform _  which is why I chose it for my business efforts instead of blogger which I was more familiar with. It's more intricate than blogger _  so more complicated _  but once you get the hang of it _  it's awesome. My jury is still out on the boxes tool....,5,05/23/2020,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,Very nice App. It does all that I want it to do _  for now.

App822,org.wordpress.android,In my opinion _  there is no search feature and the Discover section does not quickly adapt to my interests. What a terrible app! I understand that it might be meant to be used in conjunction with the website _  but that model is irrelevant in today's smartphone-driven world. I don't know who clapped each other on the back in the back office for creating this app _  because once again _  in my opinion it is terrible and they should get some BA's on the job quickly!,1,05/07/2020,67

App822,org.wordpress.android,In an effort to accommodate more people WordPress has gone from an easy _  comfortable format to a complicated _  irritating _  frustrating platform that makes it almost impossible to set up a consistent _  uniform look for every paragraph in every post you produce.

App822,org.wordpress.android,It's a good app overall _  but it's seriously buggy. There are several issues with it _  such as not getting notified about things a majority of the time _  and refreshing the page just to view your updated post _  doesn't help at all! Because _  either it shows you the old version _  or it doesn't update at all. The positive thing about this _  is that the stats and the editor are good. Please fix these issues _  because we all need it,3,04/25/2020,130

App822,org.wordpress.android,Really great and helpful app _  I'll recommend it for anyone. I also love that it saves work automatically even if you phone shutsdown. But sometimes it gets a little annoying when you type and are all ready to post _  then it publishes a previous version of your saved work - and not the latest one. But I really enjoy using it and navigating. Thank you for making my work easy _  I no write from the train _  the bus _  I don't have to carry a laptop around everytime,3,03/30/2020,124
App822,org.wordpress.android,I have worked very well with wordpress but since the last update _  the editor became complicated to use. At the begining all the editor options were in the tool bar. Now you have to press several buttons to get the option you want. The underline option is not even available anymore and if you press the ENTER button _  to pass to other line/row it let's a huge space between them (about 3 normal rows). Please do something about that _  because in this condition _  I can't even use it anymore!,5,05/01/2020,68

App822,org.wordpress.android,Needs more updates _  won't let me take my photos with phone and put them directly on the blog _  just Keeps saying unable to load. So because of that i have to email my photos from my phone to my laptop every day.... it's getting old fast. And i think it's total bull how I'm supposed to pay 100$ just to have a small walk through on how to navigate the program! Should come with original purchase.,3,04/12/2020,31
App822,org.wordpress.android,The app is fantastic but it should load faster and when it comes to customization of themes it directs me to my browser where WordPress customization tab open.

App822,org.wordpress.android,Convenient to use. First time published something. Enjoyed the journey with wordpress.,4,06/02/2020,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I have used many blog sites over last 8 years. However _  I have found that wordpress is simple to use. The layout of the platform is great _  for begginers to learn blogging. As someone who has been using WordPress for three or more years _  I find it has many options to help you make it your own. I have had trouble with other websites when I would type post _  the paragraphg would be spaced too far apart. Although _  with WordPress my post are not oddly spaced. Over all the app _  and website are great.,5,04/25/2020,66
App822,org.wordpress.android,This app used to work really well until the most recent update. Now when I'm writing a new post _  it takes forever to catch up when whatever I'm writing runs on to another row so I have to carry on _  hope for the best and go back and edit any mistakes when it's finally caught up. It's also almost impossible to start writing in a new block as the new block just doesn't appear. It's taking me twice as long to write anything now and is twice as difficult to use.,3,05/04/2020,17
App822,org.wordpress.android,If I could I wouldn't even give this app one star. The app barely works _  it's a blessing if you get your work done with less than 20 glicthes. The app freezes for no reason _  crashes frequently _  doesn't add images to the blog and is overall very laggy.,1,05/06/2020,5

App822,org.wordpress.android,uploading multiple media files creates huge congestion at server side. file upload runs into timeout and so fails. when uploading on pc _  through wordpress site it does upload one file after the other. here you send the e.g. 10 files together. I sent an email but no feedback :-( and it is definitely not sequential.,2,05/06/2020,3
App822,org.wordpress.android,EDITED- SOMETHING IS WRONG. POSTS ARE NOT POSTING _  PICTURES ARE NOT UPLOADING _  PEOPLE ARE NOT ABLE TO VIEW POSTS. PLEASE FIX. Wonderful. I like the upgraded version of this app. I've used WordPress for years but your new step forward is amazing. Just a little request though. PLEASE ADD 'SHARE' OPTION IN SITE PAGES SO THAT WE COULD SHARE LINKS OF OUR INDIVIDUAL SITE PAGES FROM THE APP FOR THOSE OF US MANAGING MULTIPLE PAGES IN ONE WEBSITE. THANKS.,4,05/01/2020,4
App822,org.wordpress.android,1. Simple controls like adding a hyperlink to the text work erratically - the pop-up to add URL doesn't appear _  when it appears _  even if I save the URL _  it doesn't reflect in the preview. 2. Editing post is not only slow _  switching between controls often doesn't work. 3. While I haven't digged into the details _  it runs slowly on my phone(Galaxy S8+) _  even when other apps are closed _  also _  the phone heats up.,3,04/28/2020,15
App822,org.wordpress.android,WordPress has been my first choice for basic website needs. I found it less than user-friendly at first _  but over time the site has improved. Past functionality was quirky and illogical when creating posts. Editing features took getting used to. Pages appearances are fine for basic website hosting. Ads are to be expected wirh this basic level of platform. Price _  is perhaps _  a bit overpriced for ease/use of website features & overall website performance.,4,04/29/2020,10
App822,org.wordpress.android,The wordpress app has always been pretty good. The new editor _  whilst great in some respects _  will hinder me in particular as I post a lot of poetry. It removes what little control I was able to have over the page form - I challenge one of the app developers to try and type out any poem within the editor. I did use the HTML editor instead _  but now that immediately implements things as hypertext. Please give me more freedom to arrange my text on the page. Italic & bold malfunction sometimes too.,4,03/27/2020,54
App822,org.wordpress.android,Used word press for years and have built 4 websites with it. Whenever there is something I cannot do the online help is excellent - they have frequently done things for me such as embed maps etc. Theres a lit of functionality I am still unable to access due to my general ineptitude but I'll find a way. The only annoying thing is that certain things are not available in the app _  just from a browser.,5,03/19/2020,59
App822,org.wordpress.android,I just downloaded this app 2 nights ago _  & I just went to open it and it won't open at all. It keeps giving me an error saying it crashed and then when I try it again _  another error says it keeps crashing. So I can't even use this app at all. I'm actually really disappointed. I'm going to have to delete this and go with Blogger _  Tumblr _  or another blogging app to start my blog now. I have a Revvl Plus made by CoolPad exclusively for T-Mobile _  & I got it at the end of May 2018.,1,04/04/2020,70
App822,org.wordpress.android,WordPress is awesome _  it makes creative and informative idea real and easy to dispatch. The only thing is that if you don't upgrade to premium you can't make money with your creativity and hard work _  and the price is costly. If WordPress can make room for creative writers who cannot afford premium price to make money with their creativity _  then it will become the best app of all time for writers.,4,04/06/2020,8

There _  we find "menu" but am unable to open the items I create. Unable to delete items because tapping on the arrow drop down button on the right only works 1/1000 times. Not user friendly.

App822,org.wordpress.android,I love using WordPress. The features have gotten easier to use over the past year _  and there is a lot of interaction with other users _  making it a kind of social media platform. That being said _  I still have some problems getting certain things to work because the optional integrations are made by other companies and sometimes they don't work well or are not intuitive. I still can't get it to post to my Facebook page _  and that is why I am giving it four stars instead of five.,4,04/19/2020,13
App822,org.wordpress.android,Block editor is VERY slow to load _  and it's a nightmare for text created elsewhere. List block turns into text block after pasting lines of text _  and it can't be changed or adjusted. Underscore text option is missing. App lags when adding blocks. Formatting in classic editor is now wonky _  especially for lists.,2,05/05/2020,41
App822,org.wordpress.android,UPDATE:4/8/20- Still some latency in publishing and cannot seem to erase old _  and long gone websites other than the 'hide' function _  but most functionality issues fixed. BRAVO! old: 1) crashes all the time and I cannot post to my sites 2) blanks out after spending lot of time writing a post in it _  then loosing all of my work because it blanks out when I hit publish and it hasnt saved 3) the worpress admin panel is bad to utilize. Most importantly _  you loose the "user" functionality.,4,04/09/2020,77

App822,org.wordpress.android,I tried this app over a year ago and I couldn't get it to work with my domain. I decided to try again and this time it worked. I love being able to post at any time without being on my computer. The only issues I'm having are that I have yet to be able to upload a picture. I think this feature is worth one whole star. I tried uploading a picture on my provider network and over WiFi _  neither worked. The other issue I'm having is that I can't seem to check categories for my post. I have to log in through my browser to do that. It may be user error but I couldn't find that option. All in all _  it works for generic text posts - at least for me. I'll take that over NOTHING!,3,03/06/2020,49

And a writer can be as wordy as they want _  even if their subjects and verbs argue and never agree. AUTHORS wait for a block of time and inspiration. Writers write. Everyday.,5,03/13/2020,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I love the app and that I can update my blog on the go _  but it crashes too much. Thankfully it saves most _  if not all that I write. That would get the fourth star.

App822,org.wordpress.android,I'm not sure if I understand how this operates _  but I own a domain name and have a hosting for a website. I had thought I could use WP to design and publish. Now _  all I am informed when I type in my website is that it is not on WP. It's all confusing especially on mobile. Is there something I don't know about?,3,02/20/2020,6
App822,org.wordpress.android,Excellent CMS. I earned my CMS skills using Drupal and only learned WordPress recently. What an enjoyable and easy time it is using WordPress _  mostly because I gauge it against Drupal's notoriety of having a labyrinthine development model.,5,03/28/2020,1

I would definitely recommend WordPress.,5,01/24/2020,13
App822,org.wordpress.android,When it works _  it's great. I can only upload a photo to my blog post maybe 10% of the time. It won't add categories and it's a useless app most of the time. When it works _  it's great. It's user friendly and easy to use. Just wish it worked more often.,2,02/21/2020,3

App822,org.wordpress.android,I love my experience on WordPress and I love the connections I have made through this app. It all started in 2013 and I have learned so much to the point of self hosting 2 sites. I recommend it especially to newbies,5,02/06/2020,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,Intuitive and easy. But downside is that it crashes with certain functions and some editing occurs on the web version only (such customization of your site template). Otherwise a fun app where you can edit your pages and posts with a few clicks.,4,02/16/2020,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,App will not open on my laptop. If I do get it to open _  it keeps reverting to the block editor which I hate! Try to switch to classic editor _  but that rarely works. I use the paid version and have my own domain. Wasted money.,2,03/01/2020,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,I love this app. It's really good. I enjoy Wordpress in general and their Happy Engineers are so prompt and helpful. The only complaint I have about the app is... When I write an article online and try to continue it on the app while I'm on the go _  the article hasn't synced. Which means my latest edits are not visible on the app. I have tried refreshing too. Does anyone else face this situation? So it completely beats the purpose.,4,09/26/2018,31

App822,org.wordpress.android,This app is very very limited in what it can do _  compared to the site. Shame _  considering users do most social media _  photography and videography from mobile devices. There is no ability to link to other pages on the site when creating a new post _  aside from manually entering the URL. Feature request: Bring up a list of links to choose from on our own site when tapping the link option.,2,03/17/2019,15
App822,org.wordpress.android,Why is this so buggy? I save drafts only to lose my progress. This is a constant battle _  and is beyond frustrating. I pay for a premium site _  and the constant setbacks are really making me consider moving to another host. The desktop version isn't any better: I spent all morning writing a post only to have it lost. Just awful.,1,12/06/2018,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,Updated regularly but there are still some glitches with blocks based pages. Dashboard features are slowly showing up on the app _  but there's a lot more to be done.,4,12/11/2019,1

App822,org.wordpress.android,Nice and so easy to handle this app,4,03/04/2020,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I like it. Clean and simple. However _  I wish the mobile version had a more robust editor. You can type and format _  but you can't really see how horribly formatted it is until you preview it. I copy and paste a lot of content from various sources _  but I can't see that it's a different font style until previewed. Great on desktop _  though.,5,10/24/2018,23
App822,org.wordpress.android,In theory _  this app could be wonderfully useful for bloggers on the go. The design _  layout _  and features provide everything I could want and need. Unfortunately _  the reliability of the app falls short. I run into problems almost every time I use it. The whole app will freeze and crash any time I try to add more than a few pictures to a post _  and what should take fifteen minutes ends up taking two hours. It is unbelievably frustrating. Editing on a mobile web browser is even worse _  though.,2,01/31/2019,11
App822,org.wordpress.android,Installed it but when I tried to add my two websites _  it said they were not WordPress sites _  which is nonsense. Ok _  so they have their own URLs and not hosted on WordPress site _  but they are built using WordPress. As it doesn't work I've uninstalled it.,1,01/10/2020,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I love my WordPress blog. I can do a lot. Lately though I'm not able to like posts from my computer or phone. I don't know if it's a Google issue _  an Android issue _  etc. I've tried everything to get the like button to work _  but nothing seems to work. I just cannot like my posts _  my friends' posts _  other blogs' posts _  etc. I've sent emails to WordPress _  but have received no help. My emails have gone unanswered. It's a little frustrating.,3,05/04/2019,10

App822,org.wordpress.android,Good app _  solid _  doesn't bog down my system even on an older phone. I wish I could change the font and such without having to go to HTML mode. I paste things in from my Google Docs _  and for some reason it makes every paragraph go to pre mode so it won't line break and I can only fix it in HTML mode. Other than that _  it's a dream.,4,10/12/2018,21
App822,org.wordpress.android,Frustrated. This app worked one moment _  then stopped all of a sudden. Then I get a new error that says the server is missing XML-RPC methods...well _  they were there a moment ago _  right? So now I can't login at all on the app.  I would just really like a smooth interface to my site so I can upload photos easily _  and this has been a hassle. Hoping it gets resolved soon.,2,06/28/2019,3
App822,org.wordpress.android,I dislike this app. There are certain reasons about this: 1. When we want to embed number of photos from my Gallery _  in my mobile phone _  into the post _  it doesn't allow to select more than one image at a time. This is so much frustrating that if I have to embed a gallery of say 10 photos _  then I have to do the embedding process 10 times. 2. Mobile becomes extremely slow.,1,10/02/2019,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Slow & not responding quickly,3,01/08/2020,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Crashes Constantly. If your entry is only short you'll be fine but a long entry with multiple pictures and it crashes to the point you cannot use the app. I'm doing a travel blog currently and do the initial set up of each update in the app then have to use the website which I find also has problems when using Chrome as the down arrows on Widgets don't work. So I'm toggling between the app _  Chrome and Firefox. Yes _  it really is fun. NOT. Please sort this out ASAP WordPress.,1,03/06/2019,6
App822,org.wordpress.android,I really do love Wordpress. It is the only free blog that has ever met my needs. I tend to write long posts and often then depression sets in and I stop writing for days _  months _  sometimes even years. But my blog is always there. It is fairly easy to use and isn't limiting _  there are plenty of blog styles that are attractive as well. I do have one issue though. I have two blogs on wordpress and wish that I could have them both on my android app without having to add the other account and password every time I switch over. I often post multiple times a day when I'm actively writing. So if you could make that password thing optional after the first time _  that would be great. Thank you _  Wordpress.,3,09/20/2018,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,couple of things could be improved _  but I feel they're always trying to improve to make it more similar to the web app and I appreciate that. keep it up! they could definately improve their ad options though. I personally wouldn't click on 99% of them so I might end removing the service _  which sucks. I was hoping to make some extra $.,4,06/02/2019,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,I love the app _  but it is very slow _  it has always been like this _  it's not encouraging me to use it when I have to wait half a minute to save anything. It has had some great improvements throughout the years _  better stats and more organized layout _  it's getting better. This is one of my must have apps at all times. Wish you even more progress in the future. P. S. The preview inside the edit section shows a different layout than the preview outside on the front card of the draft,3,11/16/2019,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Very Positive. I'm minimally familiar with HTML _  but the WYSIWYG Editor makes using it a breeze. I have been composing with the app and posting online _  but I'm increasingly confident and have been posting directly.,5,12/08/2019,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,It's easy to use and operate!,5,02/27/2020,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I wanted to like this app so much. It would have been useful. Unfortunately _  in the two weeks since installing it _  it has crashed twice. Both times losing multiple blog post drafts in the process. Losing local drafts to get a message which says _  "Posts couldn't be refreshed at this time." Lost posts _  lost time. Very frustrating to say the least.,1,01/13/2019,5
App822,org.wordpress.android,I like how WordPress keep improving each day _  but I miss the old days when the devs offer various themes (from the clean and elegant look to unique themes like Chalkboard) to basic users like me. It's quite sad that these unique themes are no longer available (or if they're still available _  you have to upgrade your site to business in order to be able to modify the CSS/HTML). Besides _  I don't know why "justify" for paragraph is no longrr available on the newest block editor?,4,04/03/2019,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,The 3-Star rating is for the app (not the platform). I love the WP platform but several aspects of the Android app need to be addressed and updated. First _  customizing your site/theme on the app is nearly impossible. The app constantly redirects you to the desktop version and even then its inconsistent. Second _  there's no way to edit Portfolio Projects within the app. A little annoying when trying to work on-the-go.,3,12/18/2018,3

App822,org.wordpress.android,I've been using this since 2012. This version has something weird happening when I try to select categories. Strange things happen _  causing frustration. If I select a category _  it doesn't show a check mark. If I go to deselect uncategorized _  it erases all of the categories. I noticed a very faint check mark when I switch off a category. The problem seems to be the check mark is white on a white background so it can't be seen.,4,09/29/2019,8
App822,org.wordpress.android,I've been on an unending search for a platform to express my thoughts (blog) WordPress gives me an easy to write _  edit and share options. it's amazing _  I got a free domain and beautiful website ( still working to make it look better) it's been a great experience. My only challenge is that I can't complete edit started on my laptop from my phone.,3,05/24/2019,12
App822,org.wordpress.android,Since changing my WordPress Dyad free theme to a paid WordPress theme (an expensive one _  Newspaper) _  my site refuses to let me log in from my Sony and Huawei phones. I can log in on my laptop _  no problem. I've cleared cookies/cache on both my phones _  but WordPress still tells me I'm using the wrong password. Yet _  the very same password works perfectly on my laptop. Also _  I can't view my stats on my two phones on the rare occassions that I have been able to log in briefly from my two Androids,1,01/17/2019,4
App822,org.wordpress.android,App is much better since I last used it. Though _  locating a specific post is tricky and time consuming (unless it's a recent post). The list will not show old posts unless you reload and continuously scroll to the bottom. Then repeat said process. I have hundreds of posts and finding one from a few years back is simply not worth doing with the app (even though I know the date and title). A search filter would be nice.,3,04/18/2019,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,I have used wordpress for years and really love it. There are quite a few little annoying quirks and it drives me insane when the developers make changes to the format that doesn't (in my opinion) improve the blogging experience and you have to start looking for the features that are now in a different place. But overall wordpress is excellent and I wouldn't use anything else. I've rated it 4 stars because of the annoying quirks.,4,11/18/2019,1

App822,org.wordpress.android,I can't write comments to posts on my own blog through this app. I have brought this up with tech support but it has not been fixed. It's good for keeping up with the site _  and checking stats _  though slower and more limited than Google Analytics. I really have to use the full website on my tablet to do much of anything.,2,05/25/2019,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,Not giving five stars. You've still got bugs. In 'My Profile' section _  I can't correct notification settings as _  half of the blogs I follow don't show up. I have to go to my PC & do it from there. Next _  the news feed isn't complete. It will show me some new posts then _  it jumps to three days later. Next _  when I try to upload pix and make a post _  WHY is there all of this extra HTML nonsense? Next _  I changed my profile icon on the PC (not site icon). Why doesn't it show up here?,3,03/28/2019,26
App822,org.wordpress.android,More a 4.5 than a full 5 _  but I do love the app. I don't use it for writing _  but it is a great way to keep up with other bloggers you follow without needing to use a desktop or laptop. The annoying thing about it for writing is that I justify my text and once you open a post to edit it via the app _  for some reason it left justifies everything. When I want to use my phone for actual blogging _  I sign in via my mobile Chrome browser.,5,05/20/2019,7
App822,org.wordpress.android,I downloaded the app and I wrote most of a blog entry on it - it crashed and I lost almost all of it. Luckily _  the website had saved 89% of it _  but I still have to rewrite the rest of it thanks to the crashing AND lack of autosaving. I won't ever use the app again. EVER. Out of all the things this app needed to do _  not crashing is the MOST important as a lost blog entry is useless no matter what other features are available.,1,09/18/2018,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,It's good but there are some miscues. I love being able to upload photos from my cellphone to the website through the app. Sometimes there's a lag time fortunately the photos show up so I can create the project on the website. I do wish I could create projects through the app since I'm using that medium instead of posts or pages to load stories about my photos. Maybe in a future edition. üòÅ,4,12/03/2019,6
App822,org.wordpress.android,Really love this app. Allows me to edit my website on the go. Besides that _  it has all the bells and whistles to bring awarness to all of our cause throw its platform intergrations.,5,02/06/2020,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,Good blogging site than any other apps. Not too classic and have more customizable options.,5,04/03/2020,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,An excellent app overall _  but there's still an age old flaw that hasn't been addressed and in fact has worsened in this latest update. And that's the issue regarding long posts. Any post averaging about 1.5-2k words is subject to slow and painful editing. And once the word count exceeds 3k _  the app hangs entirely. I haven't been able to open that one post since ages. And being a story writer _  most of my posts are that long. Please solve the issue ASAP. Thanks and regards!,4,04/09/2019,3
App822,org.wordpress.android,I'm not sure what happened _  but the app is worse than before. It's extremely buggy now. While I'm writing a post _  it would suddenly make all of my body into H1 and then freeze. I'd be forced to close the app and reopen it. Of course _  since I had to force it to close _  my changes weren't saved. It takes a few tries to open the app afterward. I'd stick to the web or mobile version if I were you.,1,09/14/2018,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Wordpress in general is absolute trash. The absolute opposite of user friendly. Be prepared to run into plenty of ridiculous and unnecessary issues that you will have to spend hours troubleshooting. Remove a featured image from a post?? Sounds simple _  right? Cutting off my leg would be easier. Do. Not. Use. This. Trash. 0 stars if I could.,1,01/21/2019,4
App822,org.wordpress.android,I'm very disappointed with this app as WordPress is supposed to be the leader for blogging. Can't save a draft just on the device when there's an internet connection. Can't create a post draft with pictures when offline. No control of the layout of photos when using "Tiled Gallery" and no preview of such posts. Unable to set geo-location for a post. This bug has been there in over a year and still hasn't been fixed.,2,12/16/2018,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,WordPress has been a great app for me for many years. It is versatile _  easy to use to is usable from many devices. The only thing I would like to see changed would be that sometimes when the GUI was updated _  some features I liked were removed or changed quite a bit. I would have liked the option to retain a legacy version of my GUI. Aside from that tiny element _  I can't say enough good things about WordPress.,4,06/03/2019,3
App822,org.wordpress.android,Often adds random styles such as font sizes in the text resulting in an inconsistent look. You then have to go into the source mode and remove it. That is frustrating and time I wouldn't want to be wasting. Generally the app is good and allows you to check stats _  make tweaks to existing posts _  create and publish new posts etc _  so if they fixed the styling issues and GUI for text editing then it would probably get 5 stars.,3,06/18/2019,4
App822,org.wordpress.android,WordPress has been a wonderful site to learn blogging on. It offers a wide variety of formats _  multiple tutorials _  updates to keep the computer program current and protected. When some updates are made it takes a little time to get used to them but they prove advantageous in the end. I have also enjoyed using my own photos on almost all of my stories and posts. Thanks WordPress for making 7 years of blogging interesting and enjoyable.,5,07/04/2019,3
App822,org.wordpress.android,I enjoy writing short blog posts with a bunch of pictures. This app lets you control and do all the things that you can on the desktop app but from the ease of your phone. This allows you to create quick blog posts on the fly. As well as you can make plenty of drafts and take a look at them to post later. I am highly enjoying this app.,5,07/08/2019,17
App822,org.wordpress.android,5 stars for Wordpress in general _  blogging with them 11 years _  but I prefer the web interface. The app is good _  but for working on recent posts only. This is an issue for me because I have to scroll for forever to get to my 11 year old posts to edit them. Also _  I can't edit events and it doesn't show stats for the event calendar on the app either. But they show on a web browser.,4,07/08/2019,14
App822,org.wordpress.android,NOTE TO SELF::: DO NOT UPDATE THIS APP!!!! After each update of yours _  I keep rolling back to version 7.8_434 and I won't be updating this app again. The more you tinker with this app _  the more frustrating it becomes. No thank you - I won't be updating your app again. EDIT TO ADD: Thank you for your reply. The simple answer is for you to put the two versions next to each other: 7.8_434 on the one side and your latest version on the other side - then you will be able to experience the differences.,2,09/26/2019,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,I requested that I sign in through my email; which was supposed to be an easier way per WordPress. They sent me a link ASAP _  but for some reason it wouldn't allow me to sign in. I kept getting an error message _  "this link has expired." Mind you _  as soon as it was sent to my email _  I immediately opened it and tried to use it and it kept giving me this same error message above. ((Such a waste of time)),1,09/25/2019,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Fantastic way to keep adding content even when in a coffee shop. The app is simple _  easy to use and doesn't have any major quirks that makes for a frustrating time. If you're looking to add content to your site this app has you covered. If you need to maintain or run your site _  this is a solid platform. Some things are obviously not possible using this _  altering your site's core structure and design can be clunky _  but the app isn't really made for that.,4,10/27/2019,11
App822,org.wordpress.android,My over all experience has been a very good one _ though there are a few issues with this app I enjoy being able to write my blog. Thank you wordpress for making it possible. I live too far in the country in rural Mississippi to be unable to obtain internet access for my laptop so therefore my phone is my only source of making a connection with the world on the blog.,5,11/07/2019,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,Nowhere near as useful as using a web browser (although that UI has also been ruined with the latest updates). Whilst formatting or blogging to any kind of standard was not good before _  the app was at least useful for keeping an eye on stats... at least _  that is _  before the latest upgrade. The once mighty WordPress is now sadly looking like the latest victim of imagined convenience destroying actual functionality. It's a shame _  but times do change.,1,01/17/2019,3
App822,org.wordpress.android,It is great and all generally but I have been frequently running into a problem and that is all my saved posts occassionally go missing or the order becomes messy for some reason even though I never log out. I have resaved those posts many times over but after a day some of them still ends up being unsaved or the order of posts become wrong automatically. Please do something about it. I use the app on tablet by the way.,3,05/03/2019,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Don't bother trying to write long _  meaningful blogs. You'll be 45 minutes into writing and the app will crash and you'll lose EVERYTHING. Day one worked flawlessly...day two..Crash! Then you go back in and that tiny message appears "you have the basic (aka) free plan so your activity may be limited." Perhaps I would have upgraded to a small paid plan had I not just wasted 45 minutes of my life. If I attempt this on my phone again and this happens _  rest assured you'll never have a paying customer.,2,11/21/2018,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,This has been a disaster ever since Gutenberg came out! Even with the recent updates _  stats still don't work and seems to think I don't have jetpack installed. I can't view my posts in the app let alone edit them _  and "schedule" posts hasn't worked for months. Also _  wjen I try to log into admin from the app to try and work out what's going on _  if claims my username and password are incorrect. WordPress is becoming less and less user friendly with each update!,1,01/19/2019,6
App822,org.wordpress.android,I had started blogging with blogger and to be honest I suffered a lot before finally changing to wordpress. There were so many problems with that platform. Wordpress is really user friendly and is so easy to use. Even a child can use it. I'm happy to be doing it the easy way üòÇ. Jokes apart _  wordpress brings blogging to you in a silver platter. You can blog even with zero computer knowledge,5,04/20/2019,30
App822,org.wordpress.android,An app with so many bugs. Completely unusable. The app doesn't register paragraph changes even when the preview shows that the paragraph is changed. The actual blog doesn't show the changes. You can't space out the images to your likings because that too is not registered. The article ends up with stanzas stuck together or images not symmetrically spaced between paragraphs. No amount of updates have fixed such problems.,1,01/07/2019,26
App822,org.wordpress.android,I went to edit a post today in this app _  and it randomly created and published an entry I'd already published before (a year ago) _  but made a new entry out of it and it's all jumbled and in one line across the page! This is really bad _  I cannot have my blog with random publishings happening I didn't authorize. I now have to go through my blog and make sure nothing is messed up. That was very jarring and I don't feel confident in using this app anymore _  I'll stick to the website.,2,06/18/2019,11
App822,org.wordpress.android,Crashes every time it has an internet connection but that connection is so bad that it can't upload data. No connection (WiFi & Mobile data turned off) is fine _  it saves localy. With a good connection it's fine. Won't upload photos so I have to publish and then re-edit when I get internet access with my laptop. Sort of loses the spontaneity. Edit: it seems to have gotten better with updates _  but so has our internet availability so it's hard to tell.,4,09/07/2019,14
App822,org.wordpress.android,Cannot access my account. Its a self hosted site. Everytime i input the username and the password _  I always get a message " Incorrect username or password". But using the same credentials i can log into my account in browser. So how are the credentials wrong? I have checked multiple times to ensure that there are no mistakes. It is highly irritating.,1,11/13/2019,11
App822,org.wordpress.android,Great app.... I can easily send my ideas out,5,01/07/2020,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,Nice and wonderful app,4,05/31/2020,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Before this _  the update made me unable to edit the picture's alignment and its details like the file name _  caption _  alt _  and description. After being updated _  problems were fixed. But after the last update _  the problems are back. Please fix it again. Thank you. I really appreciate the effort.,4,12/20/2018,48
App822,org.wordpress.android,Its been mostly wonderful...I mentioned once that it fails sometimes especially when texts have been edited and I wanna caption a photo. Whichever way _  the app does 99% of what I want done without complains. There are a few other irregularities _  like trying to follow someone on the app _  reblogging previous posts (never works on the app) _  liking people's work that I don't follow (if its not on the reader) does not work all the time and so I still find myself going to the web to get them done.,4,04/05/2019,4
App822,org.wordpress.android,App keeps freezing and crashing. I got the app so I could upload pictures directly from my phone. But the majority of the time _  something goes wrong. I thought using the app would make it more convenient to update my blog _  but it is more frustrating and time consuming than transferring pictures to my computer and uploading them to my blog from there.,2,02/05/2019,12
App822,org.wordpress.android,Can't even log in or sign up. App and website won't let me. I've spent over 2 hours trying to troubleshoot this and figure it out and it just won't work. I'm not receiving the troubleshooting emails _  no one has contacted me back _  and the FAQ section is entirely written in French from what I can see which is not helpful to me at all. I am very frustrated.,1,10/07/2018,3
App822,org.wordpress.android,I can't find the plugin option in my WordPress app(mobile) _  plz help!,5,01/20/2020,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,concept behind this app is really great. but implementation is very bad. every features has error. this app shows error in uploading Media _  savings draft _  visiting themes _  plugin and pages. how could WordPress apps has this much inefficiency? try to smoothen experience. everything is not working. just okey to write offline article. worst experience- this application is nothing but simple note taking apps for me. improvements are needed to keep your reputation dear developer.,1,06/25/2019,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,I really like this program but I don't like that it automatically uploads my drafts off of my phone when I connect to WiFi. The whole point of this app is to be able to work offline. I have half a dozen partially done blog posts sitting in my online drafts now with no way to edit or complete them without WiFi access. Currently cannot upload my articles due to 'generic error' which will not be explained to me leaving me no ability to fix it. Update: error fixed by customer service,3,07/30/2019,6
App822,org.wordpress.android,I have my blog website built on wordpress. I always liked the traditional way of writing with pen on paper. But now my toddler doesn't let me do it. I was looking for alternate ways when I found this app and downloaded it in my phone. Writing has become so much easy for me since then. I can write whenever and wherever I want to. Thanks Wordpress :),5,10/29/2019,14
App822,org.wordpress.android,Not bad for a mobile blogging app. Worlds better than the Blogger app offered by Google. There is room for improvement. The app doesn't support the Gutenberg block editor. Some of the controls are not worked out to my satisfaction. Still. If you feel the need to mobile blog _  you should be satisfied with this app.,4,11/10/2019,6
App822,org.wordpress.android,WordPress sorry I haven't reviewed you long ago _  but I'm here now. Platform is great although don't appreciate your new changes has actually took content out of blogs and poetry. But getting better. All i can say is the next version _  make it better! One thing I don't like _  is the fact that you keep half a post still to redirect traffic. I don't appreciate that any. But Im sure you'll try to correct a few of these things. üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç,5,12/06/2019,11
App822,org.wordpress.android,A great app. Very easy to use. Easy to add photos and anything else you want. Drafts can be done offline and not be lost!,5,12/15/2019,4
App822,org.wordpress.android,The app is super great to have _  I appreciate the fact that you can manage multiple WordPress websites in one location _  it is beyond just great. Would be awesome if they can add Gutenburg to mobile version. Another feature that I would like to see is to allow integration with the plugins _  take ecommerce for an example _  wouldn't it be great to manage a product from your phone? WordPress is now about more that just blogging _  time to adjust to that. The most loved feature: IT HAS NO ADS!,4,04/16/2019,95
App822,org.wordpress.android,I use this app to keep tabs on my content while on the go. I have used it to make a few posts and edit some work in progress _  and it functions reasonably well. I prefer the desktop experience for creation _  but this app has made it easy to engage with my audience real time _  and that is very important when building a presence. Five stars because it's the best I've used.,5,04/25/2019,14
App822,org.wordpress.android,Complex. Very complex and very intrusive. Free account is very limited. You can't add plugins unless you upgrade to a paid account. A paid personal account still gives you nothing _  you need to upgrade further to a business account. If you click on upgrade _  just to see how much it is _  they start spamming you with emails to complete the upgrade. In short _  it's complicated and NOT FREE!,1,11/04/2018,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I usually have no issue with the app _  but when I recently switched to Android I've been having these small bugs that it's never-endingly trying to upload some blog post that I can't find or it gets stuck in the notification field and I have to restart my phone to make it go away. Hope you can look into this asap. Thanks.,3,11/01/2018,7
App822,org.wordpress.android,The app kept crashing after I uploaded a draft with pictures. It wouldn't load every time I tried to edit a draft that contained pictures (it works for drafts that are all text). Even when I restart the app _  it will crash whenever I tried to edit posts. Since I use the app to upload pictures easily _  this app is now useless compared to the browser which can do the same things without crashing.,2,09/22/2018,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I love the WordPress app. I'm not really tech savvy _  but the app is highly user friendly. I have the app on my chrome book and my android. They work great on both - posting _  editing _  adding photos incredibly user-friendly. I pay the yearly premium price _  but as a writer who's trying to build my brand and an audience. The variety of templates adds my blog a professional _  "writerly" look. Plus the stats and metrics page is easy to understand when I check my guest traffic. Great app!,5,06/13/2019,21
App822,org.wordpress.android,Wordpress itself is excellent. It's dead easy to make a sleek _  modern blog and website. The community on wordpress is even better - so many really super people. The app is generally good but can be glitchy at times _  especially when viewing image heavy content in their "Reader". It's problem free if you keep your files sized appropriately for the web but when folk don't do that it can fail to load for a lot longer than a standard browser (e.g. 10 x longer than Google).,4,06/25/2019,5
App822,org.wordpress.android,I use this app to put pen to paper so to speak when off on my travels ready for final edits on return.  NOTE: I had problems accessing the stats after the app updated and was scratching my head as it didn't recognise the login details I use for my self hosted site.  Finally figured I had to create a Wordpress account using those details to access the stats.,5,07/02/2019,3
App822,org.wordpress.android,The app could use some work. It's great for when I'm away from my laptop _  but some customization features aren't present in the mobile app and there's a formatting glitch that makes posting difficult. I cannot customize my message _  write an excerpt _  or customize my slug when on the mobile app. I'd love it if I could. The formatting glitch happens every time I have to go back in my writing and add or delete sentences. It will change all previous text to headings. Pretty great otherwise.,3,09/23/2019,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,I like the WordPress app. It makes writing blog posts on the go easy. However _  I'm an old time user. Some of the newer features makes me confused about where I can find certain features to put on my blog. WordPress also has a ton of helpful articles but not sure where to just find them. Again _  great app but navigation is a little tricky. Wish it was more inutuituve,4,09/25/2019,7

App822,org.wordpress.android,This app makes writing a post so hard. The words doesn't appear right away and when they do they come out all wrong. It changes sentences and makes everything in need of an edit. It's annoying typing words and not seeing them right away only to come out full of errors and twice. I don't know how to explain it. At first I thought it was the tablet but I have tried it in different android devices of different generations and with every single one I have the same problem. Please fix this. I want to be able to write whenever I have a chance and having to carry my laptop with me just complicates things.,2,10/19/2018,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I finished typing over 800 words and I was trying to do a little editing before I publish. Boom _  the whole post got missing from the app. Please work on it. Never trust this app _  it crushes at crucial moments. I taught it will not happen again after updating and using the app for some time but it has happened today again _  on the 19th of September _  2019. I feel really bad right now.,2,09/19/2019,10
App822,org.wordpress.android,When i first downloaded this app -7 mo. ago it worked beautifully! i now have 2 blog sites on WordPress. For the last three days it had began freezing the EDIT page and freezing on the screen and keyboard. My phone doesn't do this when it's on the web or when I'm using another app so that's how i know the problem isn't my phone. Yesterday evening after the update installed the app wouldn't open at all. Now i need y'all to FIX this so i can give you a five star rating.,3,06/16/2019,5
App822,org.wordpress.android,This review is for Wordpress app _  not for Wordpress service in general. I've been using Wordpress for blogging since 2011 and so far I'm very satisfied. It's easy and intuitive. However _  this app sometimes doesn't really synchronize with Wordpress web and I have lost some updates because of that. I can't really use this app for heavy editing because it turns (very) slow. So I use this app mainly for checking statistics. It has a great notification tool _  I like it.,4,06/21/2019,130
App822,org.wordpress.android,The app works perfectly for about two months _  and if I had rated it within that period I would have given it 5 stars. After about 2 months _  we start getting generic error on one site _  let's call it website#1. I had two websites. I uninstalled and reinstalled the WP app and the website#1 couldn't be re-embedded _  because I got a new error on it Error 403 XMLRPC. But website#2 got re-embedded. now after two months website#2 is giving me a generic error _  and I am scared of reinstalling WP,2,06/21/2019,4
App822,org.wordpress.android,Wordpress is a great app for creating your own website _  starting a blog _  and making them professional looking even when you dont have alot of coding knowledge. It has many customization features to make it your own site. If you havent tried it out _  you may want to!! It will walk you through step by step if you dont know how to actually start your own site or blog. Its a great big blessing _  having this app when you run your own site or blog.üòÅ,5,07/21/2019,118
App822,org.wordpress.android,Adding images used to be very easy _  especially multiple at a time. Now ever since they changed to block editing adding them is five times as many clicks as before and you can only add them one at a time. Why can't we select multiple images and have them automatically inserted into multiple image blocks? My blog is image heavy and it takes forever to put them all into a post.,4,07/14/2019,6
App822,org.wordpress.android,It's a great app (5 stars) _  tho I have a problem. On my wordpress site I enabled reCAPTCHA plugin as an additional level of security on my wordpress site. Through desktop and mobile browsers it works _  because it shows the plugin so I can check it and login _  but if I go through Wordpress Android app _  there is no reCAPTCHA plugin and I can't login on my web site to work on it. Wordpress through mobile browsers (especially Opera or Opera Touch) works perfect _  but I want to use the app instead. How do I solve this?,5,08/03/2019,10
App822,org.wordpress.android,For an official app of one of the most popular blogging platform on the internet _  it's not very friendly or responsive to changes on the web version. One _  none of my pictures could be uploaded to the media _  and two _  deleted websites still remained in the list until I finally figured out how to remove them _  yet it didn't do it cleanly. Never changed for years _  probably will uninstall finally.,2,11/25/2019,81

App822,org.wordpress.android,App refuses to upload every image and every blog post. What is going on?,1,04/02/2020,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I've used WordPress for several years now as a way to keep friends and family updated about my kids' lives without having to go through Facebook. I love how easy to use WordPress is _  my parents who are not tech savvy even check it regularly. What I like the most is that I can apply passwords to the posts. It makes me feel like my kids' privacy is being respected. All around a great site.,5,04/12/2019,71
App822,org.wordpress.android,It's a good app to do quick post on the go _  but if you have the app on two devices _  phone and tablet _  they don't sync up with on another. I lost half a draft post that I did yesterday on tablet to come to the phone to only have half the post that I did 4 days ago. Disappointed that u have to write it all out again.,3,10/03/2018,15
App822,org.wordpress.android,years of excellent service wordpress has been reliable for me for many years. Support team members have helped me recover access to accounts that were connected to Gmail accounts... that due to ridiculous Google security problems and failed backup services that were in place to prove and identify ownership . wordpress has been able to go above and beyond to restore access to my personal account. even though I am on the free plan i recieved excellent results.,5,04/14/2019,6
App822,org.wordpress.android,Look. No one uses this app to publish _  we use it for the analytics _  and the analytics are reporting incorrectly on the latest Android update (on the monthly level) _  and quite frankly look horrible. As far as I am concerned _  there is not a single thing made better by this update.,2,01/19/2019,24
App822,org.wordpress.android,Thanks Wordpress _  My former complaint has being partially resolved though i would like to change and operate some page categories as blogs. Secondly _  i would like to concurrently operate two sites in the app. I noticed when i switch to a second site the first dissappears and viceversa (meaning i have to go over the process of login in afresh each time i switch sites.). For me _  Wordpress deserves a 5star if the ability to switch sites can be seamless. Thanks once more for your Prompt response.,4,02/24/2019,12
App822,org.wordpress.android,In spite of  _  best possible ways  _  the app crashes even 95 % on installing . Which was working fine Upto  _  07/sep/2019 . Just 5 days before giving this review. The fact is  _  now i am in  _  word press platform  _  where i tried to install  _  but again crashes  _  inspite of all required essentials  _  such as  _  Power _  internet connection _  data _  Wi-Fi  _  speed .all taken care of  _  even to the extent of Reverifying all my Accounts.

App822,org.wordpress.android,Considering I have only recently learnt how to read and understand the technology language _  I was amazed at how much support you can receive if need be. As far as the app goes _  wordpress have made it so easy to develop and design a website that looks professional and can boast a huge number of various apps and businesses that work hand in hand to allow you to be creative yet practical. My only issue is the way the accounts for the website are set up. you are giving a closed door to choice,4,06/17/2019,3
App822,org.wordpress.android,Pretty good app. It's not always synced up _  and some times it takes a while to load the stats _  but it's generally a pretty good experience for checking up on posts I have already typed up through a web browser. I would never use it to create posts _  but that's because I like to write in long form.,4,06/26/2019,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,I am a bit confused about which rate to give as such an app must be really hard to program _  but well... First _  on my desktop version _  I have 2 languages for articles _  but on the app only the articles in one language appear. Also _  sometimes when I update an article on the app _  the changes doesn't show on pc even though it is said "saved online". Even worse _  it erases all the changes I made once on an article cause of auto-update so the latest version got erased. Some other things I don't remember,3,08/14/2019,4
App822,org.wordpress.android,Best app for creating a free website _  with a lot of features and also good settings. A very helpful app for those who want to create their website but don't have enough money to buy such domains and also those who want to start their business through their website. Aslo it is helpful and necessary to today bloggers who wanna create their blogs and share their memories. Thanks for this app.,5,09/06/2019,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Okay so this app works and then doesn't work. I can't approve comments _  I can't reply to comments _  now I can't even draft posts because they won't upload/save. It fails continuously. I like to draft on mobile the edit on the web. Drafting worked just fine last week. Otherwise it's a nice app. The recent update looks nice and less dated but the functionality is decreasing.,3,09/13/2019,3
App822,org.wordpress.android,This is one of the most used apps on my phone. And the most used site on my computer. It's super user friendly. Lots of freebies. If you are looking for a domain _  I'd definitely look here before going to GoDaddy or one of those other sites. You can pick a theme and use a free WordPress site or upgrade to a domain of your own. I really just love WordPress. I do wish I knew it better but maybe I'll take a class or something.,5,09/28/2019,37
App822,org.wordpress.android,Allows me to work on the go _  but definitely still some bugs when it comes to actually writing and editing stories on the app,4,12/10/2019,3

App822,org.wordpress.android,No longer works. I have a self hosted website. The app worked until several updates ago when it stopped posting to the site. I uninstalled _  reinstalled _  logged in again and now it will connect to the site _  but won't do anything. Won't show posts that are on the site or allow me to post anything. Site is working fine.,1,02/04/2019,7
App822,org.wordpress.android,The only problems I have with this app are that I can't see posts from more than about a year and a half ago. I like reading really long serial stories that might go on for several years _  and I can't reach the beginning. The other thing is that I can't access the table of contents for any site.,3,03/03/2019,5
App822,org.wordpress.android,I have been a user of WordPress for twelve years and each year _  it has been updated and made even more innovative than the previous year. I love its high functioning navigational system and I appreciate the many capabilities it offers for website building and blogging. Save for a few glitches here and there _  I am completely satisfied.,4,03/27/2019,232
App822,org.wordpress.android,Good mobile interface that allows me to do easy uploads of photos taken using my smartphone. My only complaints are that drafts do not always sync across my smartphone and desktop _  and that coverage abroad is not always consistent (ie _  when I try to write blogs while traveling _  the posts do not always publish as intended even when I have good wifi access). It's definitely a good mobile blogging app though!,4,05/01/2019,6
App822,org.wordpress.android,This app doesn't work on my phone or should I say my country (Nigeria) because all he's saying is "A network error occurred. Please check your network and try again " but when am using my Gmail to login it shows " we can't connect to your Gmail account try again later". What's going on??üòë,5,11/21/2018,4
App822,org.wordpress.android,As a newbie blogger with limited social media experience I am impressed with the ease of use. I have struggles with technology and I have been able to figure out how it works. There are more advanced options to personalize your blog but I haven't really looked at those things yet. Maybe once I am more comfortable with the baby steps?,5,05/22/2019,8
App822,org.wordpress.android,It was a good app and I definitely would have rated it 5 stars if it didn't started crashing again and again and again _  every time I open it. This happens mostly when I am editing a draft/post or writing one. I would have definitely recommended this app to everyone if it didn't crash so often.,2,02/04/2019,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,The app is horrible and if you're thinking of blogging from your phone _  you've been warned. The posts lose formatting when hou want to edit them after posting _  all paragraphs are gone. Inserting photos breaks words in the middle. Photo uploads hang and keep hanging. The app doesn't support raw format but lets you choose raw format to upload which results in upload failures. I will not buy any paid plan for this type of service.,1,06/04/2019,4
App822,org.wordpress.android,I like the app because its great to check stats and maybe read a few new posts on your feed but for editing its a bit annoying because there isn't an option to save while you work. It lets you save and then kicks out of the post and then you have to go back in to carry on. My phone battery died while I was working and I lost all my work on that post because I hadn't saved yet.,3,08/12/2019,3
App822,org.wordpress.android,The app regularly crashes as I type. It freezes and grinds to a crawl just as often. The app fails to recognize letters as I type them and it deletes spaces after words. A solution is to work in html mode. It appears that these bugs are only an issue when you have images display while editing a post. The more images _  the worse the problem. It seems unbelievable that WordPress _  with its QA resources _  can't fix these issues.,2,09/23/2019,47
App822,org.wordpress.android,Really enjoy using the quick press. I feel it suits my needs quite well right now. I would suggest there be a warning or something to inform me that any saved drafts can only be retrieved if I went into the WordPress app _  and not the quick press app _  because I ended up with loads of blank blog drafts at first when I tried to go back to edit it continue my work after a distraction. Or perhaps a "continue edit" or "new" option for quick press?,4,10/13/2019,12
App822,org.wordpress.android,I love this app. I could do edits on my posts and publish them much the same way as doing that on a web browser. However _  of late I noticed the notifications don't appear _  esp. for likes and comments from visitors. Not sure if it is due to an update. Would appreciate if this issue is checked out and rectified.,4,11/13/2019,3
App822,org.wordpress.android,WordPress literally saved me. I stumbled across it after my husband's suicide. I always journaled _  but I never allowed anyone to read anything. I started a blog through this app and it lifted me out of the depths of my despair _  gave me a positive outlet _  and the opportunity to educate others about mental illness. Thanks üòä.,5,12/30/2019,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Absolutely love it. This is what I'm talking about it is the best.,5,02/02/2020,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Wordpress has been an overall easy-to-use app for my blog. However _  with the block update _  images won't upload.,2,02/15/2020,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,revised #2 I trying to use this again and it's still crashing when I use voice dictation when I load pictures first. I need to load the pictures first because of the nature of the job that I'm using this for. it seemed to be working the other day on a test but now it is crashing again. keeps crashing! whenever I load more than 3 photos and use the voice dictation _  it crashes on my Samsung j4. This was not a problem on my J2. Extremely frustrating and pretty much impossible for me to use on the j4,1,02/18/2019,49
App822,org.wordpress.android,worst user interface. you cant find or do anything . It will take you years to get something right specially if your building a website from your mobile device. I spent entire day working on this. I cant even log into my wordpress account on the internet even when I'm entering the username and password exactly that's showing in my app. So disspaointed.,2,01/17/2019,6
App822,org.wordpress.android,Useless app _  if one must disable essential site security in order to use it. and it seems that everything you need to build a free website _  is conveniently wrapped up in a Wordpress premium subscription. Pointless if I already host my own instances _  where plugin installation is free! WordPress security is akin to Swiss cheese without some 3rd party security.,1,04/06/2019,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Like many other people _  unable to fully use this app _  as it seems to have an image restriction when you wantto upload and attach an image.  I have gone through all the troubleshooting and even changed settings on the host/server and blog - still no difference. In short _  I have to re-size the photo in another app on my phone _  then attach that smaller photo into the Wordpress post.  Only an issue through the app. Following various searches and tests this seems to be an issue with the app - despite the settings I make on the app. Please fix this issue please...,1,12/13/2018,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Good grief the new block editor is awful for sharing links from a browser _  I've turned it off _  don't make it so that's the only editing option please.,4,01/17/2020,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Cheers to WP v12.5! Glad that the developers listened to the needs of it's users. Fancy yet straightforward editor. Filtered and organized blog posts screen is the best feature ever _  but a separate Private posts to another tab would be better. The app looks beautiful than the previous user interface. Overall _  I'm so happy for the updates! Been sending tickets for UI improvements and this is their answer.,5,06/13/2019,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,I used Wordpress for years and deleted my blog for a fresh start. I do ALL my writing on Mobile/Docs. I'm pretty sure you know where this is going: I cannot cut/paste without losing ALL my formatting. I use Keep to jot down ideas and docs to flesh them out: I've tried saving them as drafts but I end up with so many drafts that it makes it hard to find what I need. I know there is a plugin for PC but I do not own a PC. I use a Blutooth keyboard. If I could keep my format...,3,07/25/2019,7
App822,org.wordpress.android,since last update the app is crashing all the time even don't upload a media file always say something went wrong please try again. Normally a app work good after update but with WordPress no longer apply this rule. the app is crashing all the time you can't write a post or upload a photo for a video file. I am clear the catch. And also install and uninstall the app several times but the problem is going same.,1,08/25/2019,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,It is an awesome app with occassional need to search for some hard to find options _  but sometimes I loose my offline drafts by accidentaly overwriting them with drafts that have been saved online in the past. Also the statistics were much easier to read before the latest updates and I do not even see a widget for daily stats anymore. Overall _  thanks for the hard work!,4,09/08/2019,6
App822,org.wordpress.android,Thought it would be a good idea _  but unfortunately not. 1st problem arose with publishing plain text - error uploading despite LTE connection. Finally managed an hour after the original attempt. Now a problem with uploading a pic from the phone (granted app access to storage). Removing it as the sole purpose was to publish more efficiently without the need of sending pics back and forth.,2,10/15/2019,4
App822,org.wordpress.android,Word press is my favorite site. Easy to use _  great layout and easy way to get your blog known.,5,12/09/2019,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,Amazing! The app was easy to use! I was able to design and start writing immediately. I love It!!!,5,12/27/2019,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,Nice App for blogging,4,04/15/2020,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Needs a spellcheck function esp since default keyboard autocorrect doesn't work in the app and the app doesn't appear in my recent app tray. I can't even tell if it's opened and still running in the background ==;; The editor is quite weird too since it doesn't apply all the functions I added (blockquote _  etc) when I want to post the thing and have to use html mode to make sure in the end. Also _  can the "allow comments" etc functions be added to the post settings too? Do consider _  thank you!,3,12/28/2018,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,There should be a way to manage saved posts (sort them _  put into collections _  etc.). Moreover _  the number of saved posts shouldn't be limited. Actually the old ones don't get unsaved (when I view them on browser _  then choose "View in Reader" _  the posts are still marked as "Saved") but they are not displayed in Saved posts so I can't access them offline (which is the reason I use the save function). And when visiting someone's blog _  I prefer seeing an outline of their posts _  which can help me access ANY post of that person _  over an incomplete list of posts sorted chronically which doesn't display all of their posts (some of them are only accessible on the app through browser _  so what's the point of using the app over browser?),3,11/24/2018,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I really like WorPress and use it multiple times per day. Since around the time of the the Android update _  I repeatedly get a "couldn't perform operation" error when I try to upload photos to Media from my phone. This happens using my data plan and on wifi. It also happens in different locations _  not just on my own wifi.,4,05/25/2019,3
App822,org.wordpress.android,Oftenly makes lagging _  and finally the app will hang or crash _  then my writing is lost _  already clear up all data but never solved the problems. after updated now _  the problem still remains the same _  after i wrote many lot of words including photos _  then it will become lagging/very slow _  wasting my time to complete the writings _  suddenly it will error : the wordpress has stopped,1,06/21/2019,15
App822,org.wordpress.android,Please  _  make the comment mechanism  _  more like Quora . It would be more helpful as we generally type long comments on various blogs  _  and the small comment window makes it difficult. And improve the search feature (on discover page) _  it's ineffective for searching very old posts  _  only the recent one's come up .,4,11/08/2018,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,I enjoy using this app. Sure it has steep learning curve but once you take your time and try to learn how it functions it's pretty simple CMS plus there's tutorials online in case you're stuck. I was very frustrated and confused when I first started using it. A big plus is that it doesn't take long to load webpages unlike wix (sorry devs) 5/5 for Wordpress.,5,01/30/2019,9
App822,org.wordpress.android,One of the most problematic and difficult apps on my device.... This is even more unfortunate _  since millions of users out there trust and use worpress - while this weak app is the only real smartpgone tool available to access your site. After logging in relatively quick and smoothly _  things start by looking promising. But as soon as you start to try publishing or sharing media _  the app starts bombarding error messages. I have already contacted support and forum - without an answer....,1,03/18/2019,31
App822,org.wordpress.android,This app is terrible. Not only does it bug out while you are writing by randomly converting your paragraph to a heading format _  it will not sync with activity you do on the actual WordPress site. You will find published pages reverted to old drafts when you load them here. It is incredibly annoying. Just use the website.,1,06/11/2019,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,I am enjoying the app _  it is not super user friendly when you are trying to add additional pages. I tried to use the help function... Not much help. Other wise _  adding a blog... Easy peasy _  making sure that the blog reflects on the right page.... Not so much.,4,07/03/2019,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,A very well organized and well-suited platform for those who wish to give a personalized account of their literary interests and passions to the appropriate audiences. A Customizable and surprisingly feature rich platform _  this great tool is overall a fairly user friendly program that will be a great resource for authors and bloggers.,4,07/21/2019,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,I am a Blogger user but I love this app to interact with Word Press Users. The reader is fantastic and I am debating moving my content over because I think I would like this experience more. The only reason I am debating would be going through and transferring all my content. I love that I can use the Reader to see WP blogs. The app is also easy to use.,5,08/21/2019,67
App822,org.wordpress.android,After five years with WP _  I've now converted to the app exclusively. It offers most of the features that my laptop does with ease of my Android S9. Writing and posting is a breeze _  anywhere inspiration hits. I do however miss the variety of buttons offered on my computer _  such as highlight _  quotation _  or changing color of text. This helps delineate text in interviews for example. No shade _  just hope it helps in next upgrade. Nice app though! :),5,08/29/2019,72
App822,org.wordpress.android,Wordpress allows me to connect with my customers on a weekly basis. The free version does show adds but typically not until the bottom of the post. It's nice to be able to see the activity and visits on my sight and can even use these stats to predict if my food operation is going to be busy or not.,5,09/15/2019,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,Hey thank you for this app. It really helps me build my blog about our homeschooling. But whenever I type or scroll a post down as I edit it _  it keeps moving like an earthquake _  except it is moving up and down and up and down. Please help me with this. I get really dizzy while I type a blog post because of this problem.,3,10/03/2019,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,I really enjoy using the app _  as I use my phone to post my art to multiple places and being able to use this app makes that easier. Ever since I have been using this app _  I have enjoyed making posts through here then a web browser on desktop because it's easier to upload photos into post.,5,10/29/2019,7

App822,org.wordpress.android,Re started this app January 1st 2019 after a 8 year break. For me _  it acts like a daily devotional. Little random poems _  rants and photos. Doesnt have the impact of FB. TWTR or IG however from linking into it is rather easy. and t GB e privacy is nice and a change. check back with me 8 years later.,5,04/22/2019,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,I re-installed app on my new phone but when I go to my post sections I think App try to fetch my all posts in one go which leads my site to "503 Temporary Unavailable". My Usage statistics on Memory and Entry Processes on my hosting panel Goes very high. Sometimes I also got the error of "Resource limit reached" so Just want to suggest that don't try to fetch all posts in one go..please give "Load more" or pagination. Please reply If not got my point. Filter for published _  scheduled and draft.,5,05/24/2019,2

App822,org.wordpress.android,I need to say this. Please do something so that what ever is being typed gets saved right away. I am a very messy person. I had to type few loongg texts two to three times because of MY own negligence of removing the app from task bar by mistake. And I loose the whole text. It's really upsetting. Could you please manage to save the text as soon as it's typed. Apart from this it's not excellent app. I want to change the rating. Will be waiting for the update.,3,10/28/2018,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Absolutely THE best place to create blogs. Been on WP for 8 years now and it provides immense pleasure being creative. Just wished there were more new themes added for writer-bloggers _  and not for businesses like the last batch of new themes. Other than that _  top notch place to be to set up blogs!,5,04/02/2019,10
App822,org.wordpress.android,Wordpress is an incredible blogging app! It's fast and efficient! I have been able to connect with a whole bunch of other bloggers through it and some have become my best friends! My blog has also been able to do so well _  both of these are due to this app!,5,05/23/2019,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,Being a regular blogger _  I love everything WordPress provides us. But it can certainly be better in few cases like for while editing _  things can be confusing. It doesn't show the images and notes as it should. Also _  the block option can be little more versatile (adding section or sentence highlighting like quotes) and easy to use.,4,08/18/2019,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,Update: Thanks a lot for replying so fast. I've got what i wanted. The app is good but It's missing a very important feature why can't i set a featured image for my blog posts? Is there any option do so from the app? If yes then how? Guide me please. I'll change the rating in no time as soon as find the option.,5,08/30/2019,3
App822,org.wordpress.android,I like that I can make a blog post using this app on my phone. But after the recent update _  I can no longer type a word as it refreshes itself making me log-in to my laptop and type what I needed to type which is very inconviennient. Please take a look into this and fix this.,2,09/05/2019,4
App822,org.wordpress.android,Apps for web application are developed to lessen the burden&ease the work but this app does exactly opposite.Whenever i write blog post using app _  the default font it takes is something else.Even after trying to change font _ alignment etc it won't be saved.Sometimes I have faced the issues like drafts are uploaded without my permission to my blog.Hashtags are deleted on its own.When v have to use the web application at the end of the day to format the post _ no use to keep the app.Hence uninstall.,1,09/19/2019,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Great to upload photos from my phone directly to the site. Good for jotting down ideas and starting posts. Usually I go to the website to finish a post _  especially since you can't create a media galley in the app. That would be a great addition. No issues with syncing to the main site. Very useful overall.,5,10/05/2019,26

App822,org.wordpress.android,What else can you want from WordPress? It's always been a great place for you to publish your work. With so many option for you to choose _  no matter what your project is? You will find something to make it look professionally designed _  the rest is up to you. Great platform for starting your projects free of charge or for a low start up cost _  using for many many years. Wouldn't change for another free service _  as I have not been able to find a better one to acomudate my needs.,4,12/26/2018,19
App822,org.wordpress.android,Been using WordPress for years and always felt grateful for the ability to blog my poems for free. I understand their need for ads to finance but I do dislike the intrusiveness of some of them. The app itself is so much better than my PC experience _  though _  and I prefer to use the app for makin and reading comments and keeping track of followers.,5,05/24/2019,171
App822,org.wordpress.android,I find it best to blog from a desktop as the app can be glitchy with posts and does not have full capabilities. However _  the app is great for updates _  checking stats _  replying to comments _  and keeping up to date on what's going on with my site.,4,06/18/2019,6
App822,org.wordpress.android,I have been using Wordpress for almost 8 years now. I have watched it grow into a wonderful space for sharing words and portfolios. While it's apparent the desktop version is more optimal _  one can set up and manage an entire blog using the app. It is my chosen free blogging platform and will remain so!,4,07/31/2019,10
App822,org.wordpress.android,Really wish there was a way to leave my work in progress to check another source and return to find it still there. I spend more time trying to find where it disappeared to than actually writing the piece. Can something be done about this? If I open another page it doesnt mean the piece is done or that it should be sent to a Draft file.,1,09/02/2019,10
App822,org.wordpress.android,Fantastic cross-platform publishing app / site for content creators - bloggers in particular - with seamless social media integration. Other than the occasional publishing failure error that pops up _  especially on the android app _  the content publishing experience has been joyful for me. Since the free option itself is quite feature rich _  creators like me can simply focus on the content _  instead of the cost! ~Swamy | @PrakashSwamy,4,09/05/2019,56
App822,org.wordpress.android,The latest version of the apps is so buggy and does not even work to publish that it made me wonder if the programmers are sleeping on the job! The older version works just fine but not the latest one. It keep saying failed to refresh and nothing can be published. New Wordpress sites cannot be added either. Please read the reviews submitted here start solving the problems instead of giving us dumb template responses!,1,09/06/2019,12
App822,org.wordpress.android,I AM SO SORRY I EVER INSTALLED IT. This app is malfunctioning in several ways _  relating to strange displays of blog text. Once OVERLAPPING so the post displayed UNDER or OVER the photo of prior post. The next time _  yesterday _  so the text displayed WAY OUT TO THE RIGHT. Reader has to swipe far _  far to the keft to view it. What a disaster for a writer trying to create a following of readers.,1,10/19/2019,5

App822,org.wordpress.android,This app becomes more and more idiotic. Stats are badly organized _  slow and do not give relevant data. Posting and editing tools are worthless. This last stupid update is enough for me. Uninstall. Edit: I used this app for stats _  and implementing "Insights" was bad! Loading is slow and with the last update you cannot view individual posts. New Wordpress post editor in a browser lacks a lot options _  in app even more: options missing concerning pictures _  buttons for formatting hidden... 500 limit,1,04/15/2019,8
App822,org.wordpress.android,Countless bugs and glitches : copy/paste _  erasing parts of unselected text when underlining other parts above _  captions disappearing and becoming regular text _  creating decorated texts from nowhere when copying from a txt. editor _  editor is so laggy when text is above 4500 characters with pictures... I end up spending a lot of time correcting my text instead of writing it ! New block editor is even worse and you're forced to use it _  difficult to switch it off. (Samsung SG8 updated _  Gboard up),2,09/05/2019,96
App822,org.wordpress.android,Best blogging app hands down. You can create a new account or blog or website from scratch on your phone. It can be a little tricky sometimes but once you get over the learning curve it's great. Drains the hell out of battery though! Not really sure why.,5,01/06/2019,9
App822,org.wordpress.android,im no longer able to upload photos to my blog posts. Also previous blog posts aren't loading. For me _  the purpose of the app is to update my blog _  so without this function the app is useless to me. wow _  still have this issue despite contacting wordpress many times. Do not use this app!! it doesn't function!!,1,07/15/2019,8
App822,org.wordpress.android,i am enjoying blogging on wordpress! though i am new to blogging. The only problem i am facing is that _  during a blogpost _  the picture i setted as featured image _  does not normally appear as the featured image. Meaning when i shared the link _  at times the featured picture does not appear with the link to that blpgpost. Thank you!,4,04/25/2019,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,After paying For business account _  I am not able to log in. Cz OTP SMS is not receiving on the registered mobile number.

Horrible customer support and experience. Don't pay for this guy's. Go with Google cloud or firebase.,1,06/13/2019,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,I mostly use the app to upload photos _  which is super convenient. I don't like typing lengthy stuff on my phone and use a lot of plugins that affect publication options _  so it's not practical for me to use most of the other features on a regular basis.,4,07/25/2019,4
App822,org.wordpress.android,it's such a wonderful beautiful designed app for blogging _  posting and creation _  I love. but it's doesn't accept every type if audio and video format _  if there any you can do _  I'd be grateful so that I can load any type of format I want. but it's still a beautiful well designed app,3,08/21/2019,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Having scheduled some blogs to go live while on holiday _  and then noticing some highly visible formatting errors and typos _  this app saved me from having to pay for PC access to fix the errors. The alternative was to unpublish the blog. I don't think using just this app on my phone to write blogs from scratch is practical _  but on a reasonably sized tablet may well be usable with a keyboard and mouse. One improvement would be to include the block justification controls hence the 4* score.,4,09/02/2019,4
App822,org.wordpress.android,Happy that I'm able to create drafts fory blog and continue it on my laptop. I was able to upload the photos on the drafts then continue with the draft on my laptop with no issues. I like it because it helps me jumpstart on my blog entry and I dont have to import my photos then upload. It does save me a step. Thank you and please the app working like this with no bugs and no issues.,5,11/01/2019,79
App822,org.wordpress.android,The app itself is terrible. Most of the functionality doesn't work or works on a much more limited way than the desktop version. The app is basically a way to check basic stats on my phone. UPDATE: customer support recommendation to turn off all plugins one by one and check app _  and possibly uninstall Jetpack. In other words app will remain glorified stat checker.,1,11/22/2019,4
App822,org.wordpress.android,Absolutely shocking. I regularly have to save drafts and then go to my laptop to post as the app is incapable of doing it. Currently looking for a better platform to run my website.if this is the best WordPress can do it's embarrassing. If I wanted to post from my laptop I'd use that _  I got the app because I needed to post on the go. Shockingly poor.,1,11/23/2019,16

App822,org.wordpress.android,Actually _  for every updates of this app _  I'm waiting the 'justify' function to appear in the toolbar in compose section. For me--and I believe for other users too--its important _  so that my writing would look neat. It's already have a right _  center and left alignment. But no justify command. Hope I will use it soon. Thank you.,4,01/22/2019,18
App822,org.wordpress.android,I want to be able to visit my actual blog site in the app without having to click on my post to get there. Otherwise very convenient way for me to post. Also there might be some bug issues because a post will still say "draft" after it is already posted.,4,04/01/2019,13
App822,org.wordpress.android,If you have something you want to publish _  wordpress is great for that. They have free options and upgraded choices for people looking to monetize their website.

App822,org.wordpress.android,while i like having easier access to posting on my site _  it is incredibly difficult to edit once I've posted. when i make a mistake _  i have to open up in a search engine and log in just to edit. it shouldn't be that difficult to edit my own work on the site.,3,07/15/2019,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,app was really good before _ but after the latest update it's getting so many glitches and getting slow. if i have to paste something curser will automatically go to top of the page and i have to scroll down  _ it happens every time and app get hang so oftenly . please do something about it.,3,07/21/2019,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,Doesn't work! I need to be able to manage my website from my mobile device since I am not always by my computer. I was excited when I saw that Wordpress has an app but then I was quickly disappointed because nothing loads in the app!! I can't see my pages _  I can't see my posts _  I can't even write and upload a post! What's the point of the app if I can't manage my website?,1,11/24/2019,16
App822,org.wordpress.android,Loved it from the start and still do,5,01/16/2020,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,That's fantastic app i've really liked this app because it help me to publish my experience about anything. But the problem is i can't add audio file to it. Why plz?,5,01/27/2020,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,Hi there _  let me first tell you that I appreciate having this platform to share the gospel. But...this site has one drawback that makes wordpress a very poor choice for online discussions. Specifically _  you can NOT delete or edit anything you say on someone else's site. (But the admin. of the site you commented on can delete or edit anything you say on their site). Had I realized this early on I wouldn't have used wordpress _  but now I have so much data into wordpress that it's hard to leave.,2,05/24/2019,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,the UI is decent  _  the working around the app is easy to grasp and crisp to use. its a very good app . my only gripe with it is  _  its notification  _  neither reply feature works nor the like feature . you click but app says "reply cant be sent now" or "post cant be liked",4,05/19/2019,3
App822,org.wordpress.android,WordPress provides a dynamic _  easy to use platform for me to create and share my own content _  while interacting with other writers and audiences from all walks of life. From amateur to experienced writers _  there are many formatting options and themes to suit your personal needs.,5,06/22/2019,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,I don't have a website but I'm a reader of blogs and what I especially loved was the reader view - it's extremely reader friendly and good on the eyes. The options to like and comment are also better to use on the app. The discover section regularly brings in excellent articles and the followed sites section gives proper updates _  with good articles from followed blogs. I love the app.,5,10/27/2019,29
App822,org.wordpress.android,I have to log in each time. They claimed my password was wrong I'm sick of this. It is impossible for a password to be wrong since we make them up. Anyway in this case I used my regular password I used before and it worked. They lied by saying it was wrong password. I think it is run by Google so of course it is evil.,1,11/06/2019,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,The app needs extensive revision. No support for forms _  most of the Jetpack elements are displayed as unsupported blocks... it needs a lot if improvement. Not even formatted text displays correctly in app although it's perfect on the website.... overall not very useful to manage a rich content or media website.,1,11/19/2019,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,Really it's app not Comparison to any app if compare that what's up _  Facebook & Twitter only...100% Honestly & Customer Satisfaction also It's Free if Any blog.. Thanks Founder..Thanks WordPress...,5,12/09/2019,1

App822,org.wordpress.android,New stats interface not consistent by date between views: Example - Clicking on "View more" rarely expands the list of visitor viewed posts for a given date; instead _  it switches dates and the list changes to the one for the different date. Expanded list of first date's stats accessed remains inaccessible.,3,01/27/2019,3
App822,org.wordpress.android,I love the app. It has a great yet simple interface with an elegant professional editor that's much similar to using a laptop to write. I love the app. Excellent work. Worth noting _  it does occasionally crash but nothing to dim this review. Its good.,5,11/11/2018,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,The set up is nice _  the notifications are very helpful and customizable _  and I just love being able to check my site's stats easily from my phone. it works well _  and I use the app all the time. I think it was very nicely done.,5,04/08/2019,6
App822,org.wordpress.android,This App Has Some Serious Bugs _  I Can't Read The Other Blogs _  When I Go To The Blog Section Certainly The App Closes _  After That It Can't Be Reopened Until Someone Reinstall's It Completely Or Clear's It's Data From Settings... Please Fix This _  I Love This App _  But For Reading Other Blogs Everytime I Have To Open My Browser And Have To Navigate Manually _  Which Feels Exhausting.... _  Maybe This Is Happening Due To My OS Version Which Is Currently 5.0 Lollipop...But Still What Ever The Issue Is It Should Have To Be Fixed...,4,11/02/2018,7
App822,org.wordpress.android,WordPress is rad! it is easy to use and navigate to write your own bLog or find amazing writing and writers for entertainment _  information _  advice _  etc. on this super popular platform!! The app is so straightforward and has a clean design with complete ease of use.,5,05/29/2019,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,I thought this would help me with my business site I have using Wordpress _  so I can deal with orders _  customers and product stuff even when Im unable to get to my computer. (customers do not like to wait) This is completely useless. I cannot get to any of the functions I need _  and nothing works in it. Everything has an error. I havent had it installed for even 30 mins and I am already taking it off. i will have to use brower on my phone to get anything done.,1,07/18/2019,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Love the app and the website. Its fast to open and update and easy to navigate. sometimes the app or browser complaints or asks me to update to blocks _  dont remember which one. This happens when I create the post on App and view in browser or vice versa. please look into it.,4,09/25/2019,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,I love this app and being able to do my blogging on the go is why I love Word Press app. My smartphone is all I need to keep in touch with my blogging community _  and I have made a lot of friends through fellow Bloggers on this site. Best money ever spent.,5,10/07/2019,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,It's terrible! Application keeps crashing every now and then when saving an edit. And even when you are not saving but just using the application. It's very frustrating. I don't know what update you guys made to this version but it needs to be review and identified what is causing the crash. Thanks.,1,11/11/2019,27

App822,org.wordpress.android,Not good experience because when suddenly language chnged when I was creating profile web then I was unable to recover my domain and site,5,05/01/2020,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I like the constant improvements. One thing that I feel the developers should work on is the ability to search a post by title. Imagine you have 1000 posts on your site and you need to edit the 76th article which you probably published 4 years ago... and you have to scroll down for loooooong. Quite agonizing!,4,08/28/2019,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Terrible. Keeps coming up with couldnt sink doesnt show me any of my blogs. cant go on setting cant post nothing the only thing that works is view my site. It worked the first day i downloaded the app then i did some work to my site put some posts on etc and after that the app just went terribly wrong. whoever runs this app seriously need to fix it coz its just a joke. if i want to blog when im out and dont have a laptop with me i cant coz this app dont work. Sort this App out now!!!,1,03/03/2019,37
App822,org.wordpress.android,I still find the Block editor unusable because there is no way to convert an existing block to another type. You have to delete and create a new one before pasting in content. Pasting doesn't even work with Titles and heading blocks. They just revert to paragraphs,4,07/05/2019,3
App822,org.wordpress.android,It still needs improvement to better match on the mobile the features of the native Wordpress desktop environment. Also to integrate the new block structure of the articles. But my guess is that the development team already works on that. Good and useful app overall.,4,04/24/2019,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I downloaded it and after 2 days of using it _  it started crashing. It took 15 seconds in between updating that it crashed and booted you out. I was really hoping that I would have this app for on the go updates unfortunately it doesn't work well enough to do that.,2,09/26/2018,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Sometimes im inspired to write in the most odd times and places. i love how this app is always around for me to open it and allow my mind to freely express itself _  without worrying about needing a computer to save it all with. Great app!,5,06/28/2019,3
App822,org.wordpress.android,I have a fairly simple WordPress site and I wondered how the app would work versus the usual desktop editing _  the app is great and as far as I can tell no less feature(s) than editing in a browser. with just 2 taps I can be posting to the site _  unlike all the mouse clicks and logins of the browser mode. Great Application!,5,07/17/2019,85
App822,org.wordpress.android,Not uploading image,3,04/02/2020,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I really love this app and I think what will be the ultimate for me is if you can please make the blog posts to show the way pages now show as published _  draft _  scheduled & trash so we can keep track of all the posts we're working on and those we've published. Please do that.,4,10/14/2018,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,It is not what i was looking for .. am trying to find a website builder for my tablet i can actually do some of the code for .. i dont want to fill in line and add pictures i want to code it all . im pretty sure the regular version you can do this . although from a phone it would be hard  _  but a tablet with keyboard is no different then a laptop,1,11/15/2018,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Im still new to this blogging platform; however _  it seems easy to use and has most of the major features id expect to see. i love that it is mobile and im able to write my chapters as they come to me. thanks,5,03/30/2019,8
App822,org.wordpress.android,Nearly no function worked properly. The app updated older versions of post drafts so that the recent progress was deleted. The draft mode does not show contents like lists or images. Uninstalled. The mobile bowser version works fine _  while the app is causing more problems than is solves.,1,05/16/2019,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I can't even log into my account any more. This app is useless. It's a real tragedy _  as I used to be able to assemble posts and manage multimedia on the fly.

App822,org.wordpress.android,I love it. It's a great app for posting quick blurbs on the run or before going to sleep. The interface is simple to use for beginners and its easy to see whos reading and commenting. Great blog community!,5,05/23/2019,3
App822,org.wordpress.android,It's ok. Sometimes the post making app doesn't have the functionality you want _  and sometimes it just doesn't sorm as well as wordpress in a mobile browser (which is why the three). I mostly use it for notifications _  but even then they're better dealt with in a browser.,3,05/13/2019,2

App822,org.wordpress.android,I used to be able to update my website between my phone and my pc but now the phone app can't do anything.

App822,org.wordpress.android,WP is awesome. It's easy to navigate _  and follow other writers as it hosts a very cool community of talented web owners. Employees provide excellent support and fast personal service when there are issues. I've reached out to them several times for help and they delivered. Engineers do a good job providing social gatherings and learning seminars close to where i live. My Wordpress experience has been great. September will be a year _  and Ill be looking to upgrade and add email.,5,04/20/2019,18
App822,org.wordpress.android,What is wrong with the developer of this app?  _  you will update your app after three days it will stop working and be showing to update again!!!

App822,org.wordpress.android,would be amazing if every time I tried using the app it didn't tell me I had already used my attempts to get in to use _  and to cone back in 20mins.

App822,org.wordpress.android,Has its quirks _  but it works pretty nicely _  and is reasonably robust. Nicer experience than the browser on my Android tablet. Pity it doesn't have an off-line composition mode _  for writing entries when away from the 'net.,5,09/01/2019,2

App822,org.wordpress.android,UPDATE: I'd expected this robo response _  because it's the only one given in this reviews section... "call us".  No offense but that's the *laziest* way to handle common recurring tech issues... you (the user) do something.    Here's a tip:  put in your software an error tracking feature that uploads "cannot post" and "generic" errors and other similar "cannot do that.. failed" errors to you and YOU FIGURE IT OUT.  I can tell this software is not robustly developed and tested.  Another alternative would be for you to give meaningful diagnostic answers so we can all benefit from solutions found and discussed here.  Terrible support model going on here.   Original review:  Absolutely WORTHLESS and UNRELIABLE.  This WP app feels like an Alpha version that hasn't been tested.  Does NOT handle SHARING well if at all.  Too many bugs and failures to list.  Using Galaxy Note 8 w latest Androidd. Sad.  This is late May 2019.,2,05/23/2019,13

App822,org.wordpress.android,I love the convenience of being able to use Wordpress even on phone. But _  I can't make justified paragraphs here so that's a minus point. I hope the developers can add this justify alignment feature as not everyone is fine with left alignment.,4,08/23/2019,4

App822,org.wordpress.android,I can suggest you start your blog with WordPress.They have good packages put together _ for everyone's needs.You start out free(for life) with a lot of privileges and as you upgrade _ you get more add ons.Very easy to use and help with everything regarding your blog/site _ available 24/7.Glad I started my blog with them and have no plan to leave,5,06/03/2020,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,It doesn't synchronize well with the website. If I open an article in the app _  revise it later on the website the app will automatically erase my settings and reset my scheduled time to a different time zone about 7 hrs early. (?!) Instead of publishing at 6am _  it happens at 11pm the night before. Not professional.,2,06/03/2020,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,Works well. After using it for a couple of years now I am getting the hang of it and has posted some posts on it. Oh... I avoid the new block editor as much as possible; it's confusing.,4,04/16/2020,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,The new editor is okay _  but underlying issues in regards to nested lists (ul li li /li /li /ul sometimes becomes ul li /li li /li /ul for no apparent reason) exists with both old & new editors _  though I have no way to accurately reproduce it. This new one also appears to replace both single and double line breaks with paragraph tags _  destroying the differences. Also _  there's still no differential view to highlight the difference between the current draft & the currently-posted page.,3,04/22/2020,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,Rubbish since I updated it. I loved using this app to browse recent posts containing certain terms _  so I could see others' crafts (and get inspiration/ideas). It was great to just select a recent search and scroll/swipe through all the posts in chronological order - but this doesnt seem to work any more :( please bring it back!,1,03/16/2020,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Buggy. The visual editor has been problematic since its introduction a few years ago. I am going back to the old editor. If the old editor presents problems _  then I will move on to Evernote or something similar since I am using this app only to keep private journals. Poor all around. Both types of editors are still buggy. Seems as if this app is being abandoned by the company. Another update begets the bugs that had been fixed. These guys are spending their time fixing their own mistakes.,1,03/17/2020,7

App822,org.wordpress.android,Thanks for last Feature request. What I need now is on WordPress mobile app _  when selecting Category on a new post _  it shows the entire category list.

App822,org.wordpress.android,Error 403 everytime I try to upload my posts. Used to love this app but it has become very frustrating.. Update.. After much head scratching I upgraded my hosting package. After the site migration I found the app worked fine. Other than the initial issues which were I believe due to my old server the app is great. I can write posts when I travel and then finesse them at a PC if needed at a later date. Fantastic.,2,01/17/2020,3
App822,org.wordpress.android,Good app but it often changes styles and hangs. Workaround is that do not apply styles till all editing finished. If too much editing is needed in a post with styles already applied _  do it in text only mode. Deserve more stars but for the problem.,3,12/27/2019,1

App822,org.wordpress.android,App is not as good as web interface _  and data latency is more than update period. Data below main charts fail to display on regular basis. Frequently have to stop app in order for it to automatically show today's data; otherwise it ends at previous day.,2,12/04/2019,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,Edited review because the ap has gone down hill.....now it has not return button so you can do a new paragraph which is crazy as effects stats. And wont automatically add a capital at the start of sentance.....makes life harder to blog quickly....sort it out wordpress _  im so dissappointed ive had to move you from a 5 star to a 2 star! Update: this was temporarily resolved last week _  but has occured again today.,2,12/13/2019,13
App822,org.wordpress.android,It used to work well. After updating to Version 9.1.1 it tales about 8 seconds to add one new character to my blog on my phone! I had to edit via Site Admin. You should allow user to go back to previous versions.,3,12/31/2019,3

App822,org.wordpress.android,App is good and some issues are there in allowing comment option in new posts. When we publish a new post _  comment option for readers is always hidden. And delete option is too fast. No extra confirmation or any recovery folder for comments & posts available. It hates & really annoying. By mistakes we may delete comments or posts easily. Thats not fair. Wordpress team has to sort it out by a new update.,3,03/11/2020,0

Its Inability to Support Custom Post Types/Custom Fields makes it impossible for me to write on mobile. Is there any work around?,3,09/21/2019,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,Early versions had severe bugs making it semi-unusable. Now it can get the job done _  but there are still plenty of little rough spots. Update: suddenly it's become unusably slow and laggy when editing lengthy posts. (Update to that: extreme lagginess still unfixed years later _  and may actually be getting worse.),2,10/05/2019,6
App822,org.wordpress.android,Missing search box OK. I'm updating my rating for them to four. The app improved a lot and I can now pull up old posts easily. I'm just missing one from the iOS version where you can easily search for a post title to link to a post that you're working on.,4,10/17/2019,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I reaaly dislike the block editor. Classic one is much better: intuitive and clear.,3,02/28/2020,2

App822,org.wordpress.android,I need to edit this review _  the most valuable feature of the app were the widgets and they simply don't work!!! The values are not getting any update!! The new today widgets are missing the title of the blog. This was a nice feature on the old widgets _  light and dark themes are not wnought to identify the blogs. The widget does not keep the size _  from time to time I have to expand them. When clicking on the today widget I expect to go to today _  this was the default behaviour of the old widgets.,1,08/30/2019,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Stinks. Type a comment watch it go up in smoke when your connection isn't strong enough & the upload fails. Doesn't refresh to reflect posts uodated via desktop. Regulatly saves posts which overwrite posts akready published _  erasing previously published content. It's a goddamn mess.,1,09/08/2019,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,Updated June 2019 A lot has changed since my last review _  when I wrote that "My HTC Ones System had Updated to Android 5.0 Lollipop". It's now "Android 9 Pie" Absolutely Fantastic App. The WordPress "Happiness Engineers" truly do live up to their title. I really appreciate having a copy of wordpress on my mobile because it is the one device that is usually close to hand.,4,06/27/2019,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,This updated version has worked flawlessly while sharing photos to this app from photo resizer pro. I am quite satisfied. (old review follows) Have to agree with "steve nguy" .. old version was better _  worked flawlessly. I have 2 sites I update and now it doesn't work with either. I finally got it to log in again and now I get "jetpack failed to respond". I am doing nothing differently. The app update is creating failure points where there was none before.,5,06/20/2019,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,As this is a writing application so what is the most useful tool for a writer or a blogger? Answer is a spell checker. During an update they removed the Spell checker. What a joke. This used to be an easy to use platform _  not now!,1,06/24/2019,6
App822,org.wordpress.android,The latest update doesn't load the photos under "WordPress media." Also _  please add word count and integrate Yoast SEO in the future. thanks.,3,06/24/2019,4

App822,org.wordpress.android,The app is quite useful but the feature I miss on this app is Search option for posts.To reach at an old post _ I have to move through all posts which is time consuming.Kindly add Search option for posts to reach at a particular post for editing or sharing.,4,04/10/2019,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,I rated this app a year ago and not a bit has improved. Despite Automattic _  Inc reply here. The app does not crash - it fails to work at all to edit posts on my android. I edit posts through browser which is frustrating but possible. A major let down for me. A year ago I wrote: This app is awful. Impossible to use. It crashes and gets stuck all the time when editing posts on my Android phone. Need to use PC _  it's that bad. Recently _  the app has been messing up my posts _  as well.,1,04/22/2019,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,What a joke. No WSIWYG editing and the preview is also not showing what the post will actually look like. This app is totally useless. Update: Tried it again. Really wanted to be able to use. Still no usable editor where you can see what you actually get.. Going back to the web interface (the classic one since the new one is unusable).,1,04/11/2019,3
App822,org.wordpress.android,The app is good _  the editor is fine and the community is wonderful but when i want to add an image it always tells me to retry and when i do i end up putting two or three or none of my images. It needs fixing. But the rest is okay.,4,04/08/2019,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,App is awesome. I have already conveyed this. When I switch sites _  my previous sites goes off. I need to rather log in my account. If this app like gmail keeps me signed in the account then it would be easy for me switch just by clicking on the account rather than adding the account for every time when i need to switch. I have more than 2 accounts in worpress and i do face this issue always. Which forces me to us apps like dual apps etc. kindly provide this option in next update. Thank you.,4,02/28/2019,6

App822,org.wordpress.android,Problem is with browsing the old posts if you want to republish it. Since we are on mobile _  you can expect faster connectivity _  so featured image on post should be disabled. I was not even able to browse older posts even when the phone is connected to a highspeed WiFi. Infact editing on browser is easy to do than this app. Surely not designed keeping mobile users in mind. I would give 0 star to it.,1,02/24/2019,2

App822,org.wordpress.android,Id be happy with it but my ads do not appear as per my settings. This is critical as it means i do not get the clicks i would have if it functioned as it should. - and yes have sent an email about this and have never had a response. mind you my subscription plan states support is part of the plan.i suggest you find my emails rather than ask me to send one AGAIN.,3,02/04/2019,14
App822,org.wordpress.android,..This app CONSTANTLY force closes _  often making me lose lots of work. I have to uninstall and reinstall multiple times per blog _  it's getting worse. This is ridiculous _  please fix... *EDIT: These issues seem to have been fixed which I'm very pleased with. still waiting to write a long blog while I'm out and about and rely on the app. I'd love the edit sharing option like on the website on a laptop. Thanks,4,02/10/2019,6
App822,org.wordpress.android,Works well enough with self-hosted WordPress site. Good for making a draft or editing a recent one. No ability to search old posts or drafts limits usability. Despite all the improvements _  wordpress is still clunky and more complicated than it needs to be. There's room for some serious competition for anyone who does custom domains with Medium's usability _  podcast capabilities & memberships.,3,02/14/2019,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,WP is a good blogging platform but needs a key enhancement to get farther... ADD "bulleting" options. Plus review and fix screen displays on other engines like Safari _  I've been getting a lot of comments for it.

App822,org.wordpress.android,In the past few updates _  the app made my site's stats completely unaccessible and reachable. I am no longer able to check any of my stats without not only getting my phone frozen _  but also the app. I constantly have to shut down the app and re-open it to get the same issue all the time. Hence this _  even if it manages to load in _  I can only view the monthly stats and not the daily/weekly ones. The widget also doesn't show anything other than its unable to show the statistics for my site. UPDATE : The latest update seems to have fixed the issue.,5,08/31/2018,4

I ended up having to copy and paste all of the long text that I wrote out into a Word document. At one point _  I noticed that the text in my draft was gone. I hit the "back" button to get off that page and the WordPress ap SAVED MY BLOG AS THAT... I would have lost EVERYTHING if I hadn't had a page open on my laptop where I was editing that page and could just hit "publish" on there to repopulate the page with my text... Scary.,2,08/30/2018,5

App822,org.wordpress.android,This app is absolutely awful. I was hoping to use it for making websites _  but it's just terrible. I'm using the browser instead now _  because the app is just terrible. I wouldn't recommend this app to anyone. Rather go and use the browser for WordPress instead.,1,08/28/2018,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,Inferior in every possible way to using the online editor. This app doesn't allow you to link to your own earlier posts _  crashes often _  can sometimes delet your whole draft even unsave a previously update and saved page _  and has issues previewing images. It also cannot pull the most recent version of you updates which you created with the web editor. Woe be unto you if you mak long pots _  because after a certain size copy/paste stop working and the editor gets so slow you have to wait for the displayed text to catch up to you. What it does do well is present your stats page _  manage the site permissions and let you get a rough draft started. Though it has so many problems I'm just using the MS Office apps for my rough drafts and then copy/pasting into the web interface. I'll probably uninstall this soon because it is basically horrible.,1,08/20/2018,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,Hi developers.

App822,org.wordpress.android,The app is very efficient and convenient. The switching rom one panel to another are smooth _  and the loading of images and texts only takes seconds provided that the internet connection is excellent. I also like the feature that I can make a draft in Wordpress even if I am not connected to the Internet.

App822,org.wordpress.android,I found a major problem with the app. I was writing a draft on the app and  ---- saved it to work on it later in the day. When I got to the office _  I  ---- continued with my article and went on to publish it. However _  when I opened  ---- up my app after this _  it reverted my article to the last version that was  ---- worked on the app. This annoyed me greatly as the article was retracted  ---- from being published and reverted all the work I've done. I had to  ---- reinstate the article to the latest version on desktop but such things  ---- should not be happening. The app should not operate separately from the CMS  ---- because what's the point really if I can't seamlessly switch between  ---- desktop and mobile? I won't be using the app until this gets fixed.,2,07/17/2018,5
App822,org.wordpress.android,I think we need 'discard local changes' button.

App822,org.wordpress.android,Very unsure about this app. I wanted it so that I could write offline on my tablet _  which seemed to be working just fine. However _  a couple of nights ago I added a huge amount of content to a particular post using my PC (online) and _  when I went to update the app once it was connected to the internet _  instead of updating the app with the latest information _  it updated the blog with the last things I did offline - this doesn't seem to make any sense and I can't find instructions on how to use it so that I don't lose work.,3,07/26/2018,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I use this app for my blogs (personal and academic) but the app always  ---- crashes especially when I try to create a post _  good thing there's  ---- autosave.

App822,org.wordpress.android,One of the best apps I've used to maintain my sites from my mobile device.  ---- However _  the stats are far from accurate. Just this morning again I got 4  ---- likes on a post _  but only two views. Sometimes I get 7 users from 10  ---- different countries.

App822,org.wordpress.android,Hate to be mean but unusable as is. Traveling and blogging for family is  ---- miserable. A handful of bugs makes it unusable especially with limited  ---- bandwidth. Image uploads are parallel _  crippling performance and aborting.  ---- Every time you open your page for minor edits all images are downloaded  ---- again! Except they don't _  because they time out _  but still suck up your  ---- data plan and battery! Can't edit text while images are loading _  as each  ---- load resets focus. Want an unsaveable page?

App822,org.wordpress.android,Horrible app. It is always crashing and losing work. Right before it  ---- crashes _  it starts auto-meshing words together.

App822,org.wordpress.android,It would be nice to see the pictures when editing a post.

App822,org.wordpress.android,You said that the new WYSIWYG (visual) editor would be here soon and it  ---- was! Absolutely phenomenal job you guys. You can barely compare this to the  ---- significantly less capable Blogger app (or it's counterparts). The ability  ---- to easily create posts and manage my blog from my smartphone or tablet is  ---- fantastic. Couple that with the ability to actually change formatting  ---- (alignment _  colors _  and bullet point lists) and this is a truely powerful  ---- tool. Thanks for the great update _  it's working flawlessly so far!,5,05/21/2018,14
App822,org.wordpress.android,I wish when I read the article. The page would be pretty like how my laptop  ---- sees it. I like the photos on top with the title but on the android it  ---- didn't look like that. Not a big issue but not as visually appealing as  ---- laptop view.,4,05/17/2018,8

App822,org.wordpress.android,Only useful if you do the most rudimentary tasks. On my first test _  I ended  ---- up giving up and just logging directly into Wordpress Admin via a web  ---- browser. Photo uploads fail 50% of the time _  and the message "generic  ---- error" is a useless for troubleshooting. Worse _  the app is so basic you  ---- can't access all of your post settings. Very disappointing.,1,05/05/2018,7
App822,org.wordpress.android,Good web interface. But the Android adaptation in the app is very bad. It's  ---- a great deal of difficulty to format the post. The formatting done in the  ---- post edit page is NOT retained when the post is published. Enters and  ---- paragraph breaks are ignored and all the content is published as if in one  ---- line. Paragraph indent is not consistently implemented. Only way to write a  ---- proper post is to use the web interface. That too _  we have to write the  ---- whole post in the interface. Copying and pasting will again have same  ---- formatting errors.,1,05/08/2018,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,It's a good all to easily update or create idea in post or page. Managing  ---- is a bit tricky so I firstly use it as app for the blog. I got a bug when  ---- modify the "heading" of sentence _  the size become different _  even for same  ---- heading _  base on where you click _  what was the size before _  .. I need to  ---- load the page again to fix size,4,04/27/2018,5
App822,org.wordpress.android,The biggest issue I have with this app is that when I try to write a draft  ---- on my phone and then press the sync button _  it automatically publishes it  ---- to my blog and send it out to my subscribers. To me _  that is not what the  ---- word sync means. Rather _  I would have interpreted that to mean syncing my  ---- draft updates to match the draft updates that I have saved on line. If I  ---- want to publish something _  I want to hit a publish button that is very  ---- clear about uploading the final product to the site. I don't want to be  ---- taken by surprise when a substandard draft is on display for everyone to  ---- read.,2,04/27/2018,9
App822,org.wordpress.android,The app and the website don't work in sync with each other ! I've got posts  ---- deleted and modfied cause I saved a draft on the app _  then finished the  ---- post on the website _  and then re opened the app to find the blog rolled  ---- back to the draft. It is a huge pain to use the app this way. Would rather  ---- prefer a consistent website instead. Thanks _  but no thanks !,1,04/30/2018,7
App822,org.wordpress.android,I should be able to write in the app _  not have it lead me to a web browser.  ---- Where the app then freezes. Very frustrating.,1,05/09/2018,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,This app has one very annoying feature. If you start writing a post draft with it _  the publish time for the post will be when the draft is first saved _  and not when the post is actually posted. Let's say I start a draft today using the WordPress app. Then _  a week from now _  I finish up the draft _  but now I'm writing in Firefox on my self-hosted WordPress instance. The "Publish on" shown on the post will be the date when the draft was first saved using the app _  and not "Immediately" _  like it would have been if I'd created the draft in Firefox instead of the app.  Long story short; the "Publish on" value should be "Immediately" unless something else is explicitly configured _  regardless of if the draft was created in Firefox or using the app.,4,05/08/2018,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,Overall _  WordPress left me with a regret _  that my time would have been  ---- better wasted had I gone for another CMS provider. The quality of the  ---- customer's experience is absolutely deplorable.,1,04/26/2018,4
App822,org.wordpress.android,It's all good but the only problem is while I try to select feature image _   ---- it doesn't work. I click on a particular image and it uploads a different  ---- one almost every time.,3,05/01/2018,1

App822,org.wordpress.android,I love Wordpress _  but I freakin' hate this app. It's very unstable and  ---- worst of all _  it somehow automatically reverts some of my posts back to the  ---- draft _  which is really bad since I really on some of those posts for  ---- traffic. Terrible app. Please fix this.,1,04/18/2018,11
App822,org.wordpress.android,One thing I can't seem to find in the app is a way to manage the categorized links to external sites that I have on my blog. I will have to go to the website to do this _  unless I'm missing something (if so please let me know).,4,04/10/2018,15
App822,org.wordpress.android,A friend told me he could only scroll back to mid 2017 on my blog using the app. I figured it was his phone so I installed the app. I couldn't scroll further back than mid 2017 either. So I asked another friend online _  who I knew used the app _  to check. He couldn't get past mid 2017 either.  This app isn't good enough if the visitor has to go to my website and using a browser _  use the Archive widget on my blog.  If there is a setting that all 3 of us have overlooked _  I'd be very glad to know what that is. Otherwise _  I'll just recommend the regular Dot Com site using a browser  Update April 18 2018:  The developers got back to me and informed me that the app can only handle the latest 300 posts. So 300 posts and that is it. Since I write over 300 posts a year _  well _  that won't cut it for my followers.  The good thing _  at least now I know why my friends couldn't browse my whole archive on the app.   I appreciate the team letting me know.,2,04/18/2018,17
App822,org.wordpress.android,I'm not sure how to check who is following me. I can only see which sites I have followed. Like Instagram I want to be able to check which sites (from the ones I'm following) are following me.,3,04/15/2018,4

App822,org.wordpress.android,This app looks like it is incomplete... In particular _  if a page or a post have local updates they cannot be discarded _  and might overwrite recent updates made from the site. Moreover _  customizing a theme sends to the site. Really?,1,04/01/2018,6
App822,org.wordpress.android,Not pleased! Blog posts appear in one big unorganized list. Most of the time this list  is not in sync with the blog. I am unable to locate/load the important posts I currently work on. Please add a SHOW DRAFTS ONLY FILTER. It will make using this app much more practicable.,2,03/28/2018,15
App822,org.wordpress.android,I dare not open the app. Somehow dropping unwanted local changes to pages and posts is too hard for them _  so if you do anything wrong you must go back to your browser to revert it. And it is equally hard to query the server whether a new version is there _  so it will go ahead overwriting the server version if you just open your post in app _  no warning of course _  even if you make no change at all in the app! Allow for user mistakes _  please. Phones and tablets are not platforms tailored for creating contents.  It's a shame _  the app should be so much more useful.,1,04/03/2018,10
App822,org.wordpress.android,Overall _  an excellent mobile app including most of the desktop features. I'm just missing one really easy one: Justification for text. And there is a minor issue concerning the updates of the archives which always causes my phone not to synchronise properly when I finished an article on the computer _  saying "local draft" instead. 5* if you get that fixed. Thanks.,4,04/08/2018,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,Please put the Justify icon back in the shortcuts! And I have many issues with formatting; WP doesn't allow me to bypass the paragraphs; I can't work the bulleting and numbering. Not too conducive/easy to use for computer noobs like me.,4,04/01/2018,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,Working on an entry for the third time _  after adding a photo wiped out the text _  then the next time it blanked the whole entry. No option for recovery _  so I'm left to author in a different app and paste into WordPress. Frustrating.,3,04/03/2018,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,My issue isn't really with the app _  but the fact that I can't get any support. I've emailed and contacted their "professional user" and gotten ZERO response! I paid for personal plan _  and have the transaction record of it coming out of my account. But they have my account listed as "free" therefore I'm not allowed access to actual help.

App822,org.wordpress.android,I am really annoyed right now with what just happened. I typed an entire poem of about 8-10 stanzas on the spot and I had to pause my work for some reason. I updated the saved work and suddenly I see what? A screen with only the first three LINES of my first stanza. Now what can I do and what can you do to repay for my loss? It was definitely one of those Wordpress glitches and I am fuming right now. I HAD to publish that post right away. I have no backup _  nothing. I need some response from your side. Otherwise I am deleting my blog.,1,03/27/2018,25
App822,org.wordpress.android,5/22/18 Update: It's a real pain when you copy text over and it has tons of formatting in it _  which is difficult and time consumer to remove _  and causes all sorts of other errors. Almost not even worth using anymore to create a post. Also _  blockquote does not seem to work anymore. Finally _  the app is heavy battery intensive. Using Galaxy s7 Edge. Seems to be a problem with a recent update.,3,05/22/2018,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,what I love about this app is that you can view your site statistics live  ---- and it has a nice widget for that.... But it requires that you have jetpack  ---- running on your website which is a huge slow down and super bummer. The  ---- moment I unloaded jetpack my site speed increased exponentially but I could  ---- no longer use this app. Also _  there are several technical errors within  ---- this app when it comes to updating a post that has been initially done on a  ---- desktop computer. Also _  creating new posts is very limiting _  which you'd  ---- expect on the mobile app _  but oftentimes requires a lot of fixing once you  ---- view it on desktop.,2,07/18/2018,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Still not getting notifications. Contacted Automattic as requested but no response.   I also have to "like" posts at least 3 times before it "takes".  Original issue still not resolved:  The app has stopped sending notifications. They are enabled but I never receive them. If I go into the app on my own _  I can see the actions for which I should have been notified _  but I'm not notified. I have to go in and check manually.,2,03/23/2018,29
App822,org.wordpress.android,This app has syncing problems. I started a blog post on the app and then finished and published it on desktop version. When I went back into the app _  the post was still a draft and whatever I wrote on the desktop version wasn't there. It then synced and reversed the post back to draft with half of it missing. I had to go to WP admin on desktop version to restore to the published post and republish it.,3,03/20/2018,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,It's a great app. Except for mobile posting. I always have to manually code the font colour. Please fix this. I faced this hassle every time I posted from my phone.,5,03/27/2018,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,I am having problems logging into specific sites. When I try to view content _  it shows that I am unauthorized. HELP!,3,03/28/2018,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,It's useful to quickly do a short post and upload photos/videos from your phone to the midea collection though _  it fails when you write two paragraphs the app just closes... Usually I can reopen the app and the two paragraphs are still there automatically saved in a draft; it's annoying for anything serious. The code function went away with the latest update and now you can't put everything in a post unless you skip the app and open in a browser... It's useful to use for uploading from a mobile but not if the image is high quality _  you can trust the upload to fail over and over again _  only to have it say it got uploaded but then be unavailable to view. The last couple updates killed the hope for this getting better. Please put back the option to use HTML rather than just the editor? Like I said _  the change in the update is the only problem except _  they did not fix the close out glitch. Yes _  it happens with this app on all my family's mobile devices. Please fix the random / unexplained closing out of this app. No _  the ram was not full. Yes _  I turned it off and then back on. Only happens with wordpress. Please fix in next update. I gave four stars because it's so useful for quick / short stuff. I didn't give fuve stars because of the close out glitch.,4,03/16/2018,0

This is so broken for image controls (legacy doesn't resize at all _  acts like it does... visual eats images and never works.  Beta.. works but for some DUMB reason has stupid 'random!!!' image resize options. Arrgh! ) so now my workflow on mobile is to use this pile of steaming ... to upload images in the broken beta editor... RANDOM resize the images close enough _  publish the post but delete it _  then log into the browser editor and resize the images correctly in the library then insert into a new post. Broken but at least (FOR NOW UNTIL ITS WRECKED AGAIN) I have a work around.,2,03/06/2018,26
App822,org.wordpress.android,I don't know why but I can't write an article through the app. The app redirects me to chrome whenever I want to check my site or write something. Please fix it.,1,03/02/2018,14

App822,org.wordpress.android,The app is pretty handcuffed when compared with the web editor. The app lacks easy linking to already published posts _  a way to copy a previous post _  and the mouse support on Android is terrible - formatting buttons and most dialog boxes don't respond to mouse clicks at all. Basic interaction with the admin side _  such as comment moderation and stats are fine _  but for actually creating and publishing content _  the app is very much a second class citizen compared to the web editor. Full integration of the web editor capabilities would make for a much better experience.,3,02/13/2018,23
App822,org.wordpress.android,Wordpress App is bad. There's no comfort in posting through it. Most of the times _  you can't even see your draft _  sometimes your draft gets automatically disappeared after you have written 4-5 paragraphs. The team seriously needs to work on it as mobile posting is no longer a privilege _  it's a need.,3,02/27/2018,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,Sorry to say v9.3 is a big step backwards. Copy now displays too big in editor and line spacing is unrepresentative. Worse _  text entry is enormously laggy on Galaxy S4 running Android 5.0 _  to the point where app is virtually unusable. Will be using web editor and crossing my fingers for another update soon.,2,02/19/2018,3
App822,org.wordpress.android,I have never noticed this problem before because I do most of my writing and editing on the easier _  better-laid-out legacy web interface _  since it is less  bandwidth-intensive  than  the newer UI. The problem is that the app deletes two spaces after periods _  replacing them with one space.  Now I have to go back to the computer and reinsert spaces for ease of readability.   Only 1 bug in prior release that has bothered me -- cursor jumping around on edit screen.  This release has for some reason removed ability to upload images (either via gallery/share or from new WP menu). Need to get this fixed right away.,4,03/11/2018,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,This app should also be created for Windows phone  _  I have to borrow my brother's android phone to add images to the post. It will be much help if developers could create a app   usable in Windows phone ( I use Windows 10 ).,5,02/14/2018,2

App822,org.wordpress.android,This app worked very well prior to the last update but they had to go and play with it so that now it is a woefully painful piece of rubbish now.  My advise to the developers of WordPress is they need to STOP MESSING AROUND WITH IT.,1,02/10/2018,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,This works just okay in most aspects _  but I realise it always screws up my scheduled posts! I would schedule a timing for a completed post on my computer but this app will just revert the post to draft and NOT release it on the scheduled date. I'm considering uninstalling this and just working on my blog through Browser alone now.,2,02/08/2018,8
App822,org.wordpress.android,This is the best blogging platform. One thing that I would suggest is to allow earnings through ads on free plan also. By doing so _  a huge number of professional bloggers will turn up to wordpress and not to blogspot.  Thanks,4,02/07/2018,11
App822,org.wordpress.android,For the last God knows how many months I have had no end of problems with this app. From not being able to upload photos _  to my site being hidden when it's quite blatantly not _  and not being able to start a new post _  oy being able go into setting for about 5 seconds be for it puts me back to the main menu. Support advised reinstalling Jetpack _  but that's not changed a thing. I'm giving it one last try. I'm not the only one having issues either. There's a few ppl I know who are having problems.

App822,org.wordpress.android,Wordpress Mobile Needs some Features...  Although the Mobile Wordpress app is an incredible help as far as being able to publish "On-theGo" is concerned _  it's still lacking some key features that would "Really" allow us to "Finish" the Blog Post to our satisfaction.  Ie. Font sizing... undo button... and some other features that I'll have to go back to the App and look at later to remember what they were because I stopped using it as often for those very same reasons.   When I would use it to write Blog Posts _  I would still have to go to my Blog site and finish the post all over again! Smh...  Anyway... please tighten it up because it has some "Real Potential" to be a Great Help to Bloggers the world over once it gets tightened up and Perfected! Good Luck and Godspeed!!!! :),4,01/28/2018,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,Great app but can't update a post from the app. It keeps saying an error and keeps on retrying it self all the time... even when i exit the app it keeps on giving notifications that it failed to upload every single second.,3,01/28/2018,5

App822,org.wordpress.android,I was hoping the WordPress app save me time _  than going through the web page all the time. all I found it buffering everything to its crippling slow _  I am writing anything turned into major frustration _  and a autocorrect jumping in at the same time _  making complete dog dinner of the whole article and undoing it bigger nightmare against the buffering.  The problem is I was not touch typing at speed with my external keyboard. If I was to do that _  couple minutes later would like a ghost was typing it. It's not like my 10.1 samsung tablet is some form slow price of junk to warrant it????,1,01/11/2018,6
App822,org.wordpress.android,I can't post anything. I've tried several times to use the hoping for convenience. I have not found using this app convenient at all. I can't update posts or pages. I can't upload media files. After trying to update or upload the app continue to retry. I would love to actually be able to use the WordPress app without being frustrated.,2,01/12/2018,6
App822,org.wordpress.android,The one thing I don't like is that you guys haven't fixed the gap between lines. If there is a 'shift+enter' equivalent for the app _  please let me know.,4,12/31/2017,14
App822,org.wordpress.android,Have tried updating 2 different blog posts through this app. I received a jetpack error both times. The app starts flashing a 'draft saved to device' message _  but the drafts are no where to be found.,2,01/17/2018,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,App is easy to use _  but very disappointing upload speeds. I've tried several different WiFi networks now _  and it's always the same thing. I upload several pictures. The first few upload fine _  but then the others don't. Content also gets lost occasionally. Please fix this!,2,12/24/2017,20
App822,org.wordpress.android,Lot's of improvement in update. But when it comes to editing large post like 1000+ words _  apps hangs especially in visual display thus for large post with 1500+ word I have to use text mode and add html tags manually.  Resolve this issue..,4,01/16/2018,12
App822,org.wordpress.android,Update: **updated the other day and it's now unable to upload a post. No way to stop it from constantly retrying _  either. No way to easily find drafts. Great for managing comments but otherwise useless for me. Will have to uninstall to stop the constant retrying to upload.**Handy for typing up quick drafts when inspiration strikes but I can't imagine actually doing all your blog publishing from it. DEVELOPERS - PLEASE create the option to set the post type to "draft" as a default. I've almost accidentally published just a few sentences intending to create a draft several times. It's a pain to have to change that every time. Or if that's already an option _  where do I find that setting?,3,01/10/2018,4
App822,org.wordpress.android,I have yet to be able to connect to my own site. Even after I connected it once _  it reverted back the very next time I opened the app. It won't let me log in _  and continues to have connection errors whenever I try.,1,01/14/2018,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Should have the saving draft function. I lost my long input after accidentally pressed the back button on my Samsung Note 5. All gone. Don'T have the mood the rewrite it. There is also some problem with the format after you insert an image.,3,12/30/2017,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,Me encanta esta aplicaci√≥n.Creo que es muy completa _ y adem√°s es muy f√°cil de manejar.Por lo que enseguida aprendes a utilizarla.Lo √∫nico que deber√≠an mejorar son los planes de gesti√≥n de los blogs.Creo que deber√≠a haber m√°s posibilidades _  y que no se deber√≠a tener que pagar nada por ellos.Tambi√©n decir que tienen que solucionar el problema que se produce a la hora de publicar fotos.A m√≠ me da error continuamente _ y no entiendo por qu√©.Pero del resto _ es una app perfecta.,5,01/02/2018,1

App822,org.wordpress.android,Don't know what happened _  but all of the sudden the app won't upload ANYTHING _  then whenever that happens _  for some reason my site gets red flagged and nobody _  including me _  who owns the sight _  can look at it until I go and re-download jetpack on it. No idea why the app does that but the regular sight on PC never does this.,1,12/31/2017,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,I can't give it a full mark. The editor is so poor that I gave up and let things be. When I enter 2 times _  then publish it _  the enters don't appear and it's a little harder to read if it's like that. Please fix it soon.,3,01/24/2018,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,This app is terrible. I've had it on my laptop before and it's just as bad _  ( if not worse) than using it on the tablet. I suggest if they're going to make an app for wordpress _  they should probably allow the writers to publish their writing by centering it _  changing font size _  etc. I always have to publish my stuff after posting it and going in and correcting those mistakes making it 10 times harder than it should be. This app is made for people who enjoy writing _  not to make what they enjoy more stressful.,1,10/26/2017,27

App822,org.wordpress.android,As soon as you open this app it will upload its last version of your draft even if you have worked past that version on another device.

App822,org.wordpress.android,The app consistently erases the progress I make on a post either completely erasing my previous writing or making only the first saved version of the draft available for download and editing _  erasing my previous progess in the process. I updated and reinstalled and the problem is still here. This makes the app completely unusable and it cost me a lot of my time. Strongly suggest not installing the app until Wordpress addresses this issue in a new patch.,2,10/25/2017,3

App822,org.wordpress.android,WordPress is great _  we're still using it.  And it's free _  so we can't complain.  But the app does have many many quirks which cause problems.  Two of us edit our blog on different devices _  and posts go missing or fall out of date regularly.  I think it would work perfectly fine if you are a solo blogger.  Once a month the app will need reinstalling as it gets stuck and will not fetch all new content from other editors. We still think WordPress is great _  but the app quality itself is terrible,3,10/08/2017,3
App822,org.wordpress.android,No menu indentation/structure so it's hard to remember menu hierarchy. No option to modify excerpts for pages. Give the app the same set of features as the desktop version and Wordpress will beat all competition.,3,09/27/2017,21

App822,org.wordpress.android,I was super impressed with the app up until I went to edit a published post _  the app wasn't updated and showed my blog post as it's first orginial draft? All my edits and revisions since then are all gone. It was considered a draft again and unpublished. That was days and days of work disappeared within seconds. I will no longer be using this app.,2,09/01/2017,75
App822,org.wordpress.android,Good but missing Custom Post Type support. I add CPTs into most of my sites and only being able to update blog entries is very limiting. Image handling is a bit buggy. Really good when fixing typos or creating quick posts. The earlier versions of this app were way more functional.,3,09/05/2017,46
App822,org.wordpress.android,Uploading media does not work properly. Some files do not upload and the app does not resume automatically which is annoying. But even worse: Some files are uploaded several times if you try to re-upload and then you end up with duplicates. Also if the app closes in the background it starts uploading all media of a post again. There is also no source editing. Recently it just started crashing in the media library. In summary the media upload is useless.,1,09/17/2017,12
App822,org.wordpress.android,What an app!!! As a writer who puts in so much mental effort to produce posts. The app can't even do it's basic job. A post I have been writing the whole day just disappeared. Why don't the drafts retain the recent updates.  It's sickening I tell you. Especially if one has deadlines to keep.,1,09/12/2017,15
App822,org.wordpress.android,Thanks for the update _  it works now _  but sorry I being rude _  I want request mass upload image to media _  because it trouble me to choose _  scroll _  submit/upload and do it again till finish.  Once again thanks _  I really love your app,4,09/03/2017,18
App822,org.wordpress.android,My mobile app is working just fine. It's the Desktop app that's now an issue.

App822,org.wordpress.android,Very good usage on my Desktop _  not very practical usage on the Tablet. If you have a Mac/Desktop _  use it on there please because using it on any other device is a waste of time! But _  it is really good for the simple PC!,3,09/10/2017,3

App822,org.wordpress.android,How can I update my beta version? I saw in gitthub that there is now a version 8.3? I'm still at 8.1 and editting old posts is now slower than before. I also can't edit properly when indents/hanging indents don't show anymore.,2,09/10/2017,21
App822,org.wordpress.android,There's something wrong with the app.  I just changed my password & it's telling me my password isn't my password. Just how many damn times do i have to do this and when are you going to fix this problem.  I've always been a fan of wordpress but if this isn't fixed _  I may have to reconsider.,3,09/10/2017,11
App822,org.wordpress.android,The app is defective and its really annoying _  it doesn't sync properly with the website. So changes made later on the website are reverted back to the way they were before when you open the app _  its really annoying!,1,12/21/2017,5
App822,org.wordpress.android,Oh _  where to start with Wordpress! As a computer science student at worcester state uni _  I very much enjoy working on the internet. Wordpress is the perfect platform for blogging or normal website design _  for personal or professional use. I use it for all my blogging needs and it suffices completely. I can't think of anything that I'd want more from the app _  but there is one feature id like to learn to use/have updated for easy implementation in wordpress: links to donate small sums to the author of a pages posts and features to place specific sized ads in ones post to support Wordpress itself.,5,09/15/2017,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,Media upload is Useless and since I can upload pictures _  I will not be using this app for now. Earlier versions were way more better and easier.,2,09/25/2017,2

App822,org.wordpress.android,It used to be great but with the last couple of updates the text editor has developed a mind of it's own _  often jumping to random sentences in the middle of typing. Considering the whole *point* of a blog is to write it's utterly impractical if I end up wasting the whole session trying to stop the text editor from randomly skipping to different points in the text.,3,08/19/2017,15
App822,org.wordpress.android,This is a great App if it wasn't for 1 fatal annoying flaw. No matter how hard I try and what settings I change this App will NEVER allow you to see the most recent comments first in the blogs you subscribe to. ...it's flippen annoying to have to scroll through 700 odd posts just to get down to the bottom of the page to see your recent posts. If this app fixed this flaw _  which by the way _  the desktop version works fine _  I would give it 5 stars,4,08/16/2017,18
App822,org.wordpress.android,If Android has a better blogging app (1) What is it? (2) Why is it better? Only thing is I would occasionally like to have video in my posts _  but I also understand that not everything can be free all the time. Simply the best. Update 04/09/15: The latest update is spectacular _  looks so much better with the new formatting.,5,08/23/2017,7
App822,org.wordpress.android,Great app _  BUT when I opened it _  it automatically uploaded a post I had open and overwrote the several hours I had put into it on my other device. The devices should sync not overwrite automatically!,3,08/25/2017,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,Everything is okay except the Editing part of a published post. Everytime I tried to edit a published post it showed as Local draft and didn't get published. This is also not happening to every posts but two of them till now. I don't know what is it upto.,5,09/15/2017,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,Thanks for availing Android App but it lacks so many significant features which are available in desktop version like adding a table or pop-up.   Plus we also don't get SEO details as I'm using Yoast SEO  Plugin.,3,08/18/2017,4
App822,org.wordpress.android,Overall _  user-friendly. Just wish I could search for my published blogs like I can on my laptop. It takes a while to scroll for some that are months old.,4,08/16/2017,11

App822,org.wordpress.android,Keeps taking me out of the app to customise my page. I would prefer to stay within the app as then all changes are translated. Otherwise is good. Better on a tablet platform than smartphone _  I think.,4,08/24/2017,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,This app screews up everything you already have made. If you have used/or are using the web part of wordpress and combines it with this app...it screews up everything.

App822,org.wordpress.android,WordPress can be a dynamic living  resume  for writers who  use it professionally . This is a perfect app for those of us who are tired of Facebook and frustrated with the free for all gun-slinging format of Twitter. It's a great place to refer people you want to impress with your ability to string a few sentences together and make sense.,5,07/12/2017,14
App822,org.wordpress.android,The syncing needs to be rectified. I published a blog through my laptop and when I used the app _  it still showed it as a draft. When i went back and checked on laptop _  it had been unpublished. Whatever changes that are made on the app are synced. But the changes made from some other source is not synced with the app,3,07/09/2017,6
App822,org.wordpress.android,This app was really good. However _  since last update it has become really laggy. Now it costs 10 seconds for a sentence to appear after I've typed it. When I've uploaded images and I've saved my blog as a draft _  the images will disappear. And sometimes all Enters will be removed out of nowhere. My whole story will be one blob of a text. To fix all this will take me literally hours _  due to the enormous lag. Also _  the service is very bad. I have issued this problem 2 months ago _  when it first occurred. They told me it was probably my phone. Which it clearly wasn't _  because I followed all their tips. Now _  2 months later the app has become worse and worse. Now I've uninstalled this app. When these problems are solved this app gets 5 stars _  but now it's unworkable for me.,2,10/17/2017,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,After having used both mobile web-based browser interface and this App... prefer composing within a browser instead as the interface in there appears to be more fully featured with the added benefit of having the browser's spell check available (Firefox). The advantage of this app is perhaps the ability to compose off line.,3,09/08/2017,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Overall _  the app is well done with the design and the prime functional features availability. Personally _  as a regular user _  I would like to suggest if the developer could include the Page Attributes features and the align:Justify tool. I'm not sure with the other users _  since some might prefer cleanliness when they're posting their post _  thus the justify alignment and the parent page would make it more helpful and easier to organized their blog posts instead of needing them login to the web apps to make the adjustments. Thank you Automattic Inc for implementing this user-friendly journaling functionality apps. üòäüòÅ,4,07/14/2017,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,This app used to work fine with my self hosted blogs. However the current update does not seem to work with my SSL enabled sites _  and it seems I am not alone.

App822,org.wordpress.android,Using this app is extremely dangerous for your website content. It seems to lack version history checking _  and will push its most recent version over everything on your website. Foe example _  if you finished and published a post online but had an open version on your phone _  poof-there goes all your work. They get a couple of stars for trying to make an app _  though. It would be super useful if it just had a version control or option to manually resolve conflicting versions.,2,05/28/2017,18
App822,org.wordpress.android,I used to like a lot the app until I have lost a whole complete local draft...

Why?,4,06/01/2017,4

App822,org.wordpress.android,Why is the ESRB censoring this app as "M"? Is it because the ESRB is owned by anti piracy organization The ESA _  and as such has a hatred for open source software like WordPress because it goes against ESA's anti-copying agenda?,3,05/27/2017,2

App822,org.wordpress.android,This app has some glitches where it does not always connect to the latest posts on the website. So if you find and go to edit a post you might be editing a rough draft or old update . Then when you realize you exit out and then IT SAVES with out me telling to CAUSING me to lose lots of WORK.

App822,org.wordpress.android,My wordpress account was suspended without any explanation. Luckily I contacted them and they reinstated it after a (nerve racking) day. I have backed up my posts now and will continue to do so. Other than that it works beautifully!,4,04/07/2017,5
App822,org.wordpress.android,Have been a happy user and advocate of the Wordpress app till the recent update and am facing the following issues: 1. Can't upload any photos to my post at all. Nope _  the photo(s) don't even appear in my Media Library. 2. Batch/multiple photo upload option to my post is gone. I usually upload over 10-30 photos to my post and its beyond ridiculous if I only have the option of uploading 1 by 1?! Gallery option is not what I am looking for either!  Submitted a ticket/query to the Support/Chat to resolve the above issues. Will update my review if this is resolved! Till then _  this app is a 1 star for me. Have to resort to using back my laptop for blogging now. Disappointed as this was my on the go mobile app for Wordpress.,1,04/06/2017,8
App822,org.wordpress.android,No idea whats happened but all I get when I try to log in is be thrown to some "jetpack" login !?!?! I can't get into my account. Sent an email to you 4 days ago with no response  absolute crap. Never had any problem till a few days ago when it had logged me out at some point. Now cannot get back in. It says that I already exist. Not happy !!!,1,04/07/2017,4
App822,org.wordpress.android,When it updated _  it dumped all my log in information. Now it lets me log in and not get to the panel _  so it's unusable. So angry right now.,1,04/09/2017,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,About all this app is good for is reading blogs. DO NOT TRY TO WORK ON YOUR OWN BLOG IN ANY WAY USING THIS APP!! It will totally screw everything up _  including deleting drafts _  messing up your formatting _  dating new posts incorrectly (thus burying your post in the feed) _  etc. I'm really not impressed.,2,04/13/2017,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,Everytime that I log in the app _  my self-hosted WP website will go down!! I tried twice _  and both of time I am not even able to upload a single post without crashing my website! Absolutely the worst app ever!,1,04/09/2017,1

App822,org.wordpress.android,Latest update: all settings gone _  forces me to log in to Jetpack _  won't show me self-hosted sites already set up _  won't let me set them up again. Now completely useless.,1,04/05/2017,2

App822,org.wordpress.android,Always fails to upload media files and when updating text it sometimes uploads but often fails. It's a shame because this would be an awesome tool for blogging whilst on the move without need of laptop. Hopefully it will be improved _  I'd really like to use this app. I've rated it 2 star because the concept is brilliant but it doesn't currently work properly. Please fix. Thanks. Ryan :),2,03/11/2017,5
App822,org.wordpress.android,Upload photos now is faster. I dont have to worry its failed few times anymore. Love it! üëç i dont have any trouble with this app. And btw.. can i give you a suggest? if someday you'll have a plan to add payment method link to google play for this apps. So people can pay a plan for website they want without need to go to main website of wordpress. üòÜ Thank you!,5,03/04/2017,20
App822,org.wordpress.android,These past few days _  I can't publish a post properly. It always says error 404 _  something like that. Because of that _  I still open my phone's browser to publish a post. And I'd like to suggest that if writing a post _  can we have more editing options like text alignment and colours? I'd love to have that one on the app. ‚ù§,5,03/08/2017,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,Well _  it started of well but now I am encountering new problems every single day. The app is not user friendly. Kindly upgrade it. I have already posted my queries to the contact group. Waiting for the problems to be fixed. But this shouldn't happen. I do request you to please make it an app worth using. I just starting blogging and do not want to loose everything by deleting my account.,2,03/25/2017,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Love Wordpress _ HATE this app. You're literally just better off using your browser to do everything. Adding a self hosted site is always a problem signing in.,2,03/06/2017,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,I deleted the app because I got fed up with the fact that I barely can do anything on the app anymore. Reinstalled it thinking there will be some changes but for me it's worse. I can even see my draft or go to my home page. I can't do much. It's pointless having an app for WordPress.,1,03/01/2017,6
App822,org.wordpress.android,I thought it was good _  if a little hard to learn till I read you should use a "child " copy so updates don't overwrite your blog and you have to redo it.  That totally de-motivated me.  :( Trying to go through the steps to create and use a child copy was just too much for me to figure out at this time in my life.,3,03/12/2017,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I love the convenience and simplicity of this app! Only downside is you can't upload star points from grocery items _  you have to go to the website (but it instructs you to do so on the star point _  so it didn't affect my rating),5,03/06/2017,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,I used this on my phone all the time to work on my blog. Then _  suddenly _  it doesn't work properly. I've uninstalled. A shame because it was really good yesterday,1,04/05/2017,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,Ich finde die App an sich nicht schlecht aber ich finde ich brauche keine App _  wenn ich eh immer an den Computer muss um alles nachzuarbeiten _  weil ich am Handy keine Bilder bearbeiten kann. Man kann weder die Gr√∂√üe ver√§ndern _  noch kann man Bilder zuschneiden noch kann man sie drehen. Eine andere Eigenart ist n√§mlich _  dass die Bilder manchmal einfach gedreht hochgeladen werden. Das bedeutet _  dass ich jedes Mal extra an den Computer muss _  um die Bilder nachzuarbeiten _  was unglaublich l√§stig ist!  Schade _  weil auf dem Computer hat man sehr viele Auswahlm√∂glichkeiten f√ºr Einstellungen.,3,03/10/2017,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,Editor is missing not even half the functionality as the one in the web browser. You can't even add a heading or set the font size. The only way to do it is by going to the HTML editor and add a tag that way. The only good thing about this is being able to manage posts _  pages and comments (move or remove them). If you want to edit posts or page on your phone or tablet _  you're better to do it another one and copy + paste it in using the web browser admin panel.,2,02/22/2017,10
App822,org.wordpress.android,I blog every day and this lets me post when I am lazy. Also useful for reading my posts _  I am a poet.  Unfortunately _  today it's just not loading at all. Super frustrating when I blog everyday. I just did the post on Facebook but I hope the issue gets resolved. May be due to a recent update. Reinstalling after the issue is continuing.,5,02/21/2017,16
App822,org.wordpress.android,Absolute dog crap. Uploading pictures might as well take a century if they work at all. The formatting gets completely messed up if you don't use HTML _  but I can never switch to HTML because the photo uploads which never finish block me from doing so. App crashes every 5 minutes and has numerous glitches.  Very _  very disappointed as I love the WordPress platform and was counting on this app for a blog I was doing while traveling but it did not work at all.  Extremely unimpressed. 1/5. Would be 1/10 if I could give it such a rating.,1,02/21/2017,5
App822,org.wordpress.android,Three things plague this app for me. 1-You cannot upload on the featured image button _  you have to do that on the main screen of the site. 2-You cannot get the edit post link through the app _  have to log into dashboard on a browser. I need these links to submit post to my editor through Slack or Trello. 3-There is no word count visible. I need that since the sites I write for have a minimum word count. All three of these would make this a five star app for me _  else it is useless for me and I might as well just write through the browser.,3,02/15/2017,10
App822,org.wordpress.android,App spying on me!!! When I click on an image from the attachment screen. app says "cannot load attachment". But some ip in Washington Virginia immediately hits my site for the same image. Why???,1,02/19/2017,5
App822,org.wordpress.android,It never works for me. I can log in and see the dashboard _  but whatever I tap on _  be it posts or stats or anything other than settings _  it tells me Posts couldn't be refreshed at this time _  or Stats couldn't be refreshed at this time _  etc. and I literally can't do anything with it. Browser editing for me too I guess. It's a shame because it would've been much more convenient.,1,02/28/2017,1

App822,org.wordpress.android,Does not work with several popular comment subscription plugins. If a blog has comment moderation enabled _  and then an administrator replies to  (and thereby approves) a comment which is "pending moderation" from within this app _  the comment author will never get the reply notification email.   This is because this app appears to somehow bypass the `wp_set_comment_status` hook when administrators reply to a "pending moderation" comment within the app. The `wp_set_comment_status` hook is what fires the reply notification emails for many comment subscription plugins.  There is a clue that the developers know of this bug (I do see it as a bug) because _  in this app _  an administrator can "Reply" to comment that is pending moderation _  but in the regular WP Admin interface _  the button is labeled "Approve and Reply" not just "Reply."  I hope this gets fixed as it would be great to use this app to approve and reply to comments _  and fire the `wp_set_comment_status` hook so that comment authors can receive email notification of the replies.,1,03/02/2017,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I love blogging but I am having certain issues with this app...Someone recommended me WordPress and I installed it...But how could people around the globe would be able to see my blogs and how could I follow blogging sites..Well I am definitely having various issues... i hope you people could help me out..I joined today and I posted my first blog,4,02/18/2017,2

App822,org.wordpress.android,View admin mode  goes to external browser.  Why it's not in the app itself. Dashboard should be in app. Improve this. Give us choice to go external browser  or not.

App822,org.wordpress.android,I've been using the app for a couple of months. I think it's brilliant _  especially for quickly jotting down ideas for later.

It's great for reading and commenting on other users blogs too.,5,02/17/2017,0

Easily wrote a post _  edited _  added a photo _  tagged and categorised and uploaded while away from my desktop. Very impressed and pleased. Thank you.,5,02/11/2017,7
App822,org.wordpress.android,App crashes every time I try to open my site from the app. Kinda pointless the this point...   Update: got good support _  issue now resolved,5,02/03/2017,15
App822,org.wordpress.android,Photo uploading is decidedly broken. The multi picker works great _  but it is a coin toss whether each individual photo will upload successfully or hang at 80% and go nowhere. The only way to fix hung uploads is to delete it and then browse through your photos again to try once more. This is a huge burden when you upload 20 photos and 5 of them hang. This behavior is consistent whether on wifi or data. What's more _  the only intuitive options for a poat are "local draft" or "publish". I can't get the app to default to "draft" _  in which it is uploaded and able to be edited on my computer. Even if I only have the app as a way to upload cell photos _  it is almost worthless at that.,2,02/11/2017,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,I can login successfully but unable to switch between my sites and only shows a blank dashboard. Is there any workaround on this issue? Thanks,2,02/03/2017,5
App822,org.wordpress.android,It's really addictive _  it keeps me up all night. You can't get anywhere without spending $5 but other than that it's awesome.    Seriously though _  I like this blogging app. No problems across the board.,4,02/02/2017,7
App822,org.wordpress.android,I don't use auto correct but I do use auto caps _  auto spacing _  next word prediction and smart editor.  Maybe one of these options could also have this error?,3,02/10/2017,3
App822,org.wordpress.android,The app is not having any undo redo option while writing any post in it if you mistakenly press delete button it will delete all from draft post and changed data gets save as draft.,3,01/31/2017,14
App822,org.wordpress.android,I really like the WordPress model for blogging _  but it's a big thumbs down for app as none of my posts are being published _  despite pressing publish they are only being saved as drafts. Thanks for getting back to me _  I've now done that and it worked.,5,02/15/2017,1

App822,org.wordpress.android,Twice now I've spent an hour writing a post _  on a crappy edge connection (while on vacation) and then it deletes them. At random. No explanation _  no way to undo or see a previous version. Utter trash. Needs a local database that saves different versions as you write and so when this horrifying problem occurs _  I can roll back the post to a version before it deleted every friggen thing in it. Never using this app again. I cant trust it. I've just wasted two hours of battery life on it.,1,01/09/2017,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,I have been on the computer since 1991 Microsoft 2.3 and am practiced not template design building pages...slowly spent hours to work  trial and error. These free and even subscribed Web builders are difficult to apply Mostly due to memory limitations. ... I find WordPress very proactive and useful Save Publish Edit  Action   These need better position and simpler explanations Thank you P's.  I am 75 years old,4,12/13/2016,4
App822,org.wordpress.android,Absolut essential features like adding serveral pictures at once straight to a post are missing. Will have to go back to just use the webinterface in a browser. If only i could use the webinterface offline... And why should i allow the app access to my camera to upload pictures from my sd card???,1,12/08/2016,11
App822,org.wordpress.android,Turns out the problem was with my Website provider. Thanks to very responsive help from them and from the WordPress help desk it's all solved now.     ==== cut here====                                                         I haven't found any way of getting "Local Changes" actually published. Gone through all the motions _  chosen "Publish" from the "Publish/Revert" option. Nothing. The app isn't of much use without this...,4,12/16/2016,3
App822,org.wordpress.android,Unable to upload images on my mobile that I have been using for months.  When I tried on my tablet _   it says something about a new way to upload an image and it worked.   There is no such message on my mobile.  The only message is "unfortunately WordPress has stopped working".,5,12/17/2016,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,I really love the App _  does everything that I need to get done _  but this new update has lost the more botton that I just love _  or maybe it's there and I just can't see it. You know the one that breaks a post so it doesn't display the full post on your homepage _  where is it?  Please make it come back. Thank you,5,12/10/2016,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,It's a good app but I noticed you can't search for old  pictures within the app database. You have to keep scrolling down endlessly.

App822,org.wordpress.android,Wordpress has joined the herd of sheep who think that forcing rediculously complex and impossible to remember passwords _  without WRITING IT DOWN somewhere _  will make their systems more secure.  WRONG!! The wise geeks at WordPress have completely missed how the real world works. I have now written my new 25 character letter/number/symbol password down so that I don't have to change it every time I've forgotten it when logging in. The trouble is now everyone else can see it too.  DUH!!  Well done geniuses.,1,12/11/2016,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,1. Add read more features to blog posts 2. Adding of word or pdf files 3. And optimize reliability and speed,4,12/09/2016,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,This app is so bright it hurts. You're trying to read _  write and relax _  but the blank color scheme reminds me more of the sun hitting my face at 6am than of me relaxing while browsing.  This app doesn't have some sort of front page like imgur has for example _  instead all we get is the "discover" feature which only promotes bland _  vague and uninteresting posts with no personality. Just look at it right now! Where are the people sharing relatable stories _  or video game strategies _  or book or tv show reviews or something? All the posts featured there are just... unattractive _  to say the least. And it's the only source of new content there is _  otherwise you have to look it up manually.  There are no set categories or tags _  instead you make them up and unless people type them up exactly like you did they won't see your post _  which is counterintuitive and discourages finding new posts or bloggers.  People can disapprove or even edit your comments. That is twisted _  discourages freedom of speech and opinion sharing and even allows people to literally put words in your mouth by changing your original comment to whatever they want.  You can't dislike posts or comments _  so the voting system is pointless. You might think otherwise because Twitter and Vine have no downvotes _   but they promote discovery of new content in various ways _  while WordPress does not.  The search bar doesn't work. I've tried finding my own posts with the exact same title they have and they don't appear.  All of these factors make it feel deserted and lacking of a community _  and discourage new users of getting into writing or reading on WordPress. Also there used to be a eay to add a black outline to images; a necessity when the background is white.,2,12/20/2016,2

As a nature photographer _  I am away from an internet connection frequently and this app requires a connection to function.,4,12/04/2016,7
App822,org.wordpress.android,I rely very heavily on this app to keep me posted about notifications because for some reason _  the website doesn't do it as quickly on neither my laptop nor my desktop.

App822,org.wordpress.android,As a psychologist and educator for many years _  I have come to the conclusion that "communication" is one of the most critical things all of us can do in a sometimes unpredictable world.  Word Press as a technology has opened my eyes to believing that what I think and say does matter--to someone _  somewhere. Thanks Word Press _  and keep up the good work.  Gerald D. Nunn _  Ph.D.,5,12/01/2016,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,The app is easy to use _  but it is 50/50 whether it will upload photos or not _  forcing me to go to the website (half the reason I got the app was to edit offline) _  and twice now I have been using it when the app randomly deletes half my post. So that's a few wasted hours _  and with no undo _  draft _  or backup feature _  I have to go back and rewrite everything I just wrote.,2,11/11/2016,10
App822,org.wordpress.android,Wish it had an option to display a compacted list of blog posts _  so you can see at-a-glance what's coming up and what's just been posted. Also annoying that you have to add authentication to upload blogs on insecure WiFi. No other app requires this.,3,10/24/2016,45
App822,org.wordpress.android,It's been two time since i had to register with same password and both the the times i was able to register.. got confirmation of registration .. but when i try to open it again with same link ot says"email not valid".. then i had to download this app but the problem still persists...,1,11/13/2016,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,I just wrote a long description of my rating and it has an error when i submitted it. I really would  like to use this app but.... if I click on app icon _  it opens a blank blog page and i cannot back out of cancel. Help,1,11/06/2016,4
App822,org.wordpress.android,What happened? Everytime I update a post by the app _  the entire story disappears. Only the title left. Would you explain this? There have been 3 posts I've updated today and all those three are gone. Of course it will take a hard time to rewrite all over again. Completely ridiculous. This used to be a great app I really love. Please give response. Thank you.,1,11/08/2016,15
App822,org.wordpress.android,It does not allow untitled post to be published whereas I have installed auto generate title plugin. It should allow publishing post same as web interface,4,11/15/2016,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,Everytime i put a space between words _  it kept coming back together. So I can't write a thing _  have explored all the setting but still can't fix this. Wasted 2 hours just looking for solution.,2,11/12/2016,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,I downloaded the app to write posts offline and upload them when we had internet connection. I wrote 3 posts and saved them as local drafts _  the  first 2 deleted themselves at different points. It's impossible to load photos into drafts. What should be a useful app is very frustrating and bordering on useless.,2,11/29/2016,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,Wordpress has taken an app that has been steadily improving and removed the ability to verify links while writing or editing posts. No longer useful and will be headed back to a browser. Very disappointed with version 5.6. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Response to WordPress Support: When I first noticed the change to the ability to use links within the editor section of the app _  I contacted support.  The change was confirmed and I was told that links will no longer function. Hence one star rating.,1,10/26/2016,21
App822,org.wordpress.android,So buggy. Rarely loads posts _  fails to update posts _  throws errors loading post categories _  image uploads usually fail. It's clunky to use _  the UI seems to be from 1997. Only has about a third of desktop features.  I'd gladly pay if someone built this app properly _  but this thing's a train wreck.,1,11/14/2016,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,Am really enjoying this app right now. It's fast and easy to use. Only would want WordPress to improve on the category thing _  I wish it could categories every post automatically. Thanks,5,11/17/2016,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,Stats won't refresh _  connection error messages _  won't load media... Uninstalled and downloaded 3 times _  but no change! So disappointed! I could do with a WP app while on the move!!!!,1,10/26/2016,6
App822,org.wordpress.android,Please we liked it when if we wanted to up load a photo it just comes up _  now just to up upload a photo it now has to load which takes time. Pls we do not like the idea of our photos loading.,1,11/01/2016,3
App822,org.wordpress.android,the app is amazing. using it for months. but in the previous version(5.9) the color of the 'cursor' was white _  what created much more  problems during copying or pasting. now it's replaced with gray one. thanks for this.,4,10/26/2016,5
App822,org.wordpress.android,I don't know what happened _  but as of this morning _  my wordpress app is no longer working correctly.

App822,org.wordpress.android,I used to like it _  but now after new update on my Android phone _  everytime I want to check my stats _  posts _  etc it complains that my log in and password are incorrect . Even if I reset my password on a Web version it still complains about my credentials which is very annoying.Could you  please fix this issue because at this moment is useless I affraid. Interestingly _  iOS version works fine.,2,10/16/2016,18
App822,org.wordpress.android,For the most part _  I enjoy managing my blog with the app alone. There are some features unique to the web version _  which I definitely understand. However _  with the latest update _  posts in the reader do not appear to be in chronological order with the blogs I follow _  and there doesn't seem to be a way to sort posts. The first couple are recent _  then there's some from a week ago _  and then more recent. Good app overall _  but this feature is quite frustrating.,4,10/18/2016,5
App822,org.wordpress.android,It's a good app. Helps you publish posts _  view notifications _  comments _  themes. Helps you set or edit pages. What else can be needed. Except preview doesn't display Hindi correctly. Updated; reverts to previous version.,4,11/05/2016,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,I really love this app as it allows me to change themes and adds beauty to my writings.But _ I want some changes as well .Like  _ Log out option is not available  _ if I want to log out  _ nor there is an option for two IDs . Looking forward to this change. :),4,10/16/2016,12
App822,org.wordpress.android,Terrible interface _  doesn't link online _  formatting missing soooo much. Saves automatically _  no undo...endless list. Impossible to use!,1,10/16/2016,5
App822,org.wordpress.android,It's good but I miss the admin options as well. I miss those features when I post a post. For instance _  when I hit post it puts all the post together (published _  draft _  scheduled) why can't it be separated) and why can't I create gifs for a post. That would be nice. I should have the same features from admin as the app.,3,10/23/2016,3
App822,org.wordpress.android,WordPress has been an important part of my life for a while now. Having an app for keeping track of updates is great but the interface is not so good. The app is not smooth or clean. It's very complex with less features.,2,10/14/2016,7
App822,org.wordpress.android,The app was great in my old fone but when i installed it in the new device (redmi3sprime) _  i stopped getting notified from wordpress when somebody likes or replies to my comments. I have checked with the notification settings n app settings n they are ON. I checked with the settings on my fone too.  Yet im not getting any notifications. What do i do? .,2,10/07/2016,11
App822,org.wordpress.android,Each time I go on my follow sites and I click on something than go back and older post pops up in the middle of the new ones and and it keeps happening and can't find my place again,5,10/29/2016,7
App822,org.wordpress.android,(new review _  previously one star) Works great _  interface seems a little crowded _  but gets the job done and is a better experience than the mobile site. Can't get this to run very well if at all when on my SD card _  not sure if that is on the app or my phone. (Reason for one star review _  before moving it to internal storage),4,10/12/2016,4
App822,org.wordpress.android,I previously had an issue with inserting images and was asked to contact the support team. However _  the problem seems to have fixed itself _  so I'm guessing it was an awful internet connection causing it _  not the app itself.,5,10/31/2016,4
App822,org.wordpress.android,It's good and I mean in general. Not only the so but what is really the use of writing if no one is going to read _  comment or like it. Everyone wants to be on their own path and do not even want to compensate those that write with encouragement and they lose that zeal and courage to write thinking that nobody likes their posts.,3,01/28/2017,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Gives too much line spacing. Check my blog posts _  then click on sales contacts nationwide. Some paragraphs have normal single line spacing while other paragraphs have very very long line spacing.,1,10/07/2016,3
App822,org.wordpress.android,If I click a WP link on social media or on the web from my mobile browser _  why doesn't that link automatically open in the WP app in my mobile? That would save my time (to have to log in again on mobile's web browser when I am already logged in on my WP app).,2,10/14/2016,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,I'm still waiting for the 'more editing tools'. My posts are more in text so i need kind of justify _  align right & left _  etc. It will be better if you can add all editing tools on the web version to the app _  so i can give ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ thank you very much üòÑ,4,10/11/2016,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,My posts disappear right in the middle of my writing them! They just disappear _  no trace _  not in draft. I had finished a really long post and a proof reading to hit send _  poof _  it's gone. It's annoying,3,10/12/2016,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,I love the new design! I've been using this app since 2012! And I love it _  it's by far the easiest blogging app you can use!  I highly recommend this app to every one! Thank you automatic for creating such an easy app!,5,10/06/2016,4

App822,org.wordpress.android,Previous version (on my Android phone) wouldn't let me access my Notifications _  so I just updated the app _  hoping this would help. Now it won't even let me in to my own site unless I click on View External - but then I no longer have access to any options like Stats _  edit _  etc. Not user friendly _  and very frustrating.

App822,org.wordpress.android,I love it except lately with the last update _  I've had posts that I'd been working on just disappear. All that writing ... gone. Very frustrating. Other than that it's great. Very handy and I can update my blog from anywhere any time.,4,10/06/2016,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,On an older version I couldn't get the app to load at all. Since updating _  the app is getting better. Now the main issue is sometimes it fails to connect to the internet _  forcing me to use the browser instead of the app.,4,10/05/2016,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,All good _  but why can't you change font sizes etc in the app? Particularly makes cut and paste quotes look terrible. Even just to cut and paste text match the destination formatting would be good.,3,09/27/2016,11
App822,org.wordpress.android,It is very useless app. I have entered all correct log in details but even though it fails. Very poor app.,1,10/10/2016,1

App822,org.wordpress.android,Blog post is saved as draft but won't publish. I clicked publish multiple times and it notifies me that the post is published however I can't see it when visiting my blog site. Gets really frustrating,1,09/26/2016,3
App822,org.wordpress.android,Works great _  I haven't had any issues with crashes or things not operating properly. It works better than the website sometimes!,5,09/26/2016,6
App822,org.wordpress.android,The new version has a delay as you write _  meaning you have to constantly amend your work. Highly frustrating. Please amend as it is a great app otherwise.,3,10/05/2016,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,Would you like to trust the certificate anyway? I press yes but not working please fix this issue,2,09/27/2016,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,I can access my site and keep track of it very well with this. I guess that was what this was meant for in the first place. To actually write and post content i still prefer to use my laptop because the experience is far smoother that way. But actually keeping track of views and comments and everything is far easier with this.,5,10/20/2016,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Compared to online  _  even on mobile _  it lacks formatting features. Also _  it's glitchy. Sometimes unclicking the number list feature erases the entire note _  and sometimes the quotes causes the formatting over any paragraph under it to go far right.,2,10/05/2016,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I really like the simplicity from using wordpress blog Keep the good work _  Wordpress team!,5,10/06/2016,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,Easy to use blog service _  simple picture integration _  Blog on the go and stay current. Edit on the fly.,5,10/21/2016,18
App822,org.wordpress.android,Recent updates render the app very frustrating.   Copying in text is overriding the style sheets _   formatting all jacked up.   This app was very clean before the updates and I would joke with iPhone users who had to use alternative ways to handle their blog (like Evernote _   etc).   Now _   I am considering these alternatives because of the poor changes made in this update.,2,09/28/2016,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,A Ctrl+Z or undo feature & Recycle bin for deleted posts. I've had to retype my blog 4 times now because the app wiped it clean twice _  the third time I was copying half the story and it cleared it instead. I'm now typing in Google Keep to avoid any further hours lost!!,3,10/01/2016,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,This app is wonderful for blogging and creating sites-lots of cute editing options and a nice platform. Totally recommend it!,4,10/28/2016,1

App822,org.wordpress.android,I made a page for a game I play and I love how easy and mostly intuitive it is to use. Its so easy to manage and update content and I like being able to see comments posted without having to actually go to my page. The only down side I have run into is iOS users seem to have difficulties viewing the page and that can be a problem for me as many people in the aforementioned game are iOS users,4,09/17/2016,16
App822,org.wordpress.android,Does not allow you to login to a self-hosted site. Worse _  the forum moderators are not interested in solving this problem. They merely  cut off any comments about this problem.  Work around: delete the app. Access WordPress with a browser.,1,09/19/2016,15
App822,org.wordpress.android,Has many of the features of the main site. Easy to use. Frequent updates. Looking forward for more enhancements - one feature sorely missed is feedback. Would love to be able to notify and receive notifications of feedback. But overall _  I think the WordPress team is doing a fabulous job. Thank you and continue to be the best!,5,09/18/2016,22
App822,org.wordpress.android,The app was very useful until updated . Can't find drafts and also can not edit draft. Now the new feed is just in the mess. Instead of showing the lastest post from blogs that I follow like it used to _  now it wasn't sorted by time and make it hard to find new posts.,2,10/24/2016,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I like the app _  it provides ease of access to your site's stats and other things _  but I've noticed some things missing. The addition of the add read more tag in the post editor would be nice for starters.,4,09/18/2016,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,Now unable to add new posts via the app. Can't even log in to a self hosted site again if you log out. Keep getting error messages. Makes the app useless.,1,09/20/2016,3
App822,org.wordpress.android,No option to view the HTML editor; makes things like embedding video from youtube impossible. What's the point of an Android app if I have to use a web browser to do some things anyway?,3,12/17/2017,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Reader layout changes aside _  which are annoying _  the reader itself is auto refreshing now _  but it's also not showing posts like it should. I'm seeing blog I follow not showing in my followed sites list _  but showing by tag. Please keep working to fix this.,3,09/24/2016,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,You should definitely install and use this _  if you want your site ruined beyond repair.,1,09/19/2016,3
App822,org.wordpress.android,At the browser _ we can insert documents.but by this app _  only option is to insert video and image and not any other thing.     Please solve this issue so can anyone insert documents or compressed zip folders easily. Please......,1,09/24/2016,1

App822,org.wordpress.android,Used to be a good app. But it sucks big time now. I can't upload images. It always gives and error. I'm going to uninstall this app. This would have been very useful for creating a blog while being mobile.,1,09/12/2016,19
App822,org.wordpress.android,Simple and easy to use _  can post wherever i am,5,09/12/2016,11
App822,org.wordpress.android,This app is flat awful and unusable for a blog with images. First you have to insert a photo into a post to get it into your media library. Then you have to select the same photo to be the featured image. BUT then the post will show the SAME photo twice! So you have to delete the photo from the post and leave it as the featured image for the post to look normal and not retarded. Would be a million times better if you could select a featured image from local library,1,09/11/2016,5
App822,org.wordpress.android,I am not sure what happened. On Thursday _  this app was amazing. I used it to do work when I was on the road _  updating different things on the dashboard from my app. No joke _  I loved this app. I manage 5 sites through it. I went to Canada and came back to the states this morning _  and now I have to go through the Internet to access the dashboard which means I have to log in every time too. Ugh. This is terrible for someone like me who does web page admin on the go. Big fail _  wordpress.,1,08/28/2016,36
App822,org.wordpress.android,Just blogged photos of all the new fabric i bought with sizes and it crashed and lost all measurements. I also wish it wouldn't just save local draft as I had an issue with phone version and couldn't edit on laptop till I published it. Frustrated.,2,09/17/2016,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I used to love this app _  but the latest update has removed the "save" button from the "edit image" screen _  meaning I can no longer add captions or image metadata. A horrible oversight by the WordPress team!,1,09/13/2016,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Updated to 4* after excellent developer response. Will update to 5* after App update...ORIGINAL REVIEW...Can no longer edit OFFLINE with photos included in the latest version on my Androids. You must have an internet connection.  I compose most of my photo heavy entries in very remote areas with no internet and save the local Draft until I can connect.  This change has made the program  unusable for my purposes.  Previous version was a 5 star product.  What a shame.,4,09/03/2016,17
App822,org.wordpress.android,Needs more work. The app also fails to load all followed posts. Unless you open it every few hours you can look forward to missing some of the posts that you would have liked to have seen. I loaded my Reader in the app _  and compared it with the browser version. In 12 hours I lost 50 posts. So. Useless if you only check once daily. Also needs better text formatting control.,3,08/30/2016,4
App822,org.wordpress.android,I'm using Xiaomi Redmi Note 3. Ever since I downloaded this application _  I cant log in _  it said something went wrong _  and I didnt know why.

App822,org.wordpress.android,I used to run my site from the mobile device _  worked smooth and fast. A few weeks ago the app stopped uploading images to the site and now I can no longer look at the stats from the site. Hopefully this is updated soon.,1,09/07/2016,5
App822,org.wordpress.android,Two things: 1. How do you change the permalink (slug) of the post? 2. How do you edit the text on the sharing options? Other than that it's a good app.,4,09/06/2016,1

App822,org.wordpress.android,Update: Taking the suggestion from dev to use the support _  got response: the help support close until September 22nd (today is the 12th) ....  Check the error myself _  maybe the xmlrpc.php? install the suggested 5 year old plugin _  rename the file _  still cant _  check forum? a lot of the same problem but no answer.  This is fresh installed wp ---------- I never had success with this app for self hosted WordPress _  two main problem _  to login & to upload pictures _  always this problem _  i tried this app last year _  now _  the same problem still appear,1,09/12/2016,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,Checked user name and password several times. . Even sat in front of pc and copied 3 times letter by letter.. reset password twice.. still unable to log in.,2,09/04/2016,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,For a long time in my previous blogs _  I couldn't write unless I'm on a computer. Well _  this app convinced me otherwise!,5,08/26/2016,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,It wasn't going well but after few chats with the support team everything went perfectly okay.,5,08/31/2016,4
App822,org.wordpress.android,Went to create a blog post today using my WordPress app and discovered that the editor is some weird _  useless version of what it was before. I can't do anything in it like I can in the web based editor such as indent _  center _  size/place images _  etc....literally every major function but basic typing is gone. Where did it go and how do I get it back? If this is not fixed I am uninstalling the app as it is totally useless to me without the full version of the editor. As well _  the web based editor crashes EVERY SINGLE TIME I do an update to a blog. Makes editing virtually impossible. - - - I received an automated response to this review which said _  "You can switch back to the app's old editor: Go to App Settings in the app and toggle off the 'Show Visual Editor' option. However _  some of the features you mentioned (such as indenting or aligning text) weren't part of the old editor _  either." - - - Found the setting. That leaves ONLY the HTML editor and does not fix the problem...at all. And _  previously _  before this change _  the editor in my app and the web based editor were identical in their features.,1,09/09/2016,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,Really weak app. Literally lacks all features of wordpress aside from simple posting,1,08/31/2016,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,Hi I can't seem to log into the app or through the website. I've tried several different devices Android and iOS. I'm a contributor to a site and not the admin does this make a difference?,1,09/06/2016,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,So I updated the app yesterday and wish I hadn't. Was happy with the layout showing stats and view site together but now it has moved view site to bottom of screen and has a tab called Plan _  which looks like a tool to sell your add ons.,3,09/12/2016,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,REVIEW UPDATE: Thank's for the feedback and solution. I found the revision in WP Admin and revert back to what I've post and update at PC. This is a great feature to be able revert back to previous work.  my feedback: maybe the word update button in the draft or post can be change to save? or maybe _  we can have sync button to get the latest updated draft or post either in the web or in our phone _  before we start writing. this app can check for the last modified date either in our phone and the one in the server _  right?  PREVIOUS REVIEW UPDATE: All update and published post that I work on PC was overwritten by this app _  click update _  I thought it will update what shown in my mobile phone as per what I've done at PC _  BUT it upload my draft that I have in my phone.. totally wasted my hour in front of computer.. uninstall it! Might thinking to change other website to start my blog,5,09/06/2016,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,I mentioned the reader I meant I'm not able to view my site in-app. I like using this app even when there's issues but I'd love it if the reader returns. I do like the addition of searching for posts via keywords & hope that stays. An improvement would be if the posts related to the keyword(s) weren't in random order by date. Also _  I've noticed when I try to visit self-hosted sites it goes to their blog in-app it'd be nice if they were available to view in reader.,3,08/02/2016,39
App822,org.wordpress.android,This app is not very good. It worked on one of my devices for a little while. But it doesn't let you login to external sites very easily. Even though I'm typing in the correct password and username and url I can still not login on the app but I can online. Needs fixed.,2,08/13/2016,12
App822,org.wordpress.android,I have so much trouble getting the spacing I want between sentences and paragraphs. Also _  sometimes I copy and paste and it's nearly impossible to get the fonts right. There is no built in font list. Please fix!,2,08/23/2016,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,The app is really good at what it does but it has some problems with uploading photos some times in the posts _  the uploads would just freeze and is missing a search function for categories and a tags picked like on the web version. Other than that is really good to go and useful!!,4,08/02/2016,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,I normally use my phone to write blogs and then suddenly after this update _  I'm not able to do a single thing properly. It's so disgusting. The pictures won't upload and then suddenly after writing a whole post _ the article disappeared. Moreover _ after I uploaded my article _  I wanted to edit it but then it won't show up in the blog post section. Do something about it. It's getting difficult to write.,1,08/16/2016,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,This app is good only for viewing daily stats. Other wise its useless  _  it can't upload pics  _  and after writing whole blog it says sorry blog can't be uploaded!!!!! Please fix these errors otherwise I have to delete this app!!!,1,08/24/2016,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,...but just barely. Every time you people update you screw something else up or you take away something we had before. Please... do us a favor... get out of the business... stop pretending you know what you're doing... find some programmers that care... and you people can go flip burgers for a living. I've had enough. Uninstalling and happy to be rid of you and the app that has become pretty much worthless thanks to you losers.,1,08/09/2016,28

App822,org.wordpress.android,I did write a review about the app crashing and looking my drafts the other week. I've got a new _  updated phone and got the  app. There's some problems that are still in the app as in my old phone. When wanting to add a picture from my phone gallery _  most pictures don't show up and they aren't in order so it's hard to find the ones I want. Sometimes _  when I click somewhere on a line or in a paragraph to type it selects the very beginning of the post or the very end and not where I click. Thanks,3,08/28/2016,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,The View Site feature was really the only feature I use in this app. The View Site that opens externally is pointless _  I don't need an app that launches another app _  I can launch Chrome directly if that's what I need. I know Chrome renders better and everything but that is not an excuse to remove a feature. App uninstalled.,1,08/04/2016,11
App822,org.wordpress.android,In some instances _  editing in "webpage" view mode (as opposed to "html") will alter the code -- even if you don't change anything and immediately toggle to "html." Making "html" the default view should be a workaround _  but as it is _  I have to save my script in a 3rd party app and re-paste it in if I want to make any changes since my script is immediately ruined the instant it opens in "webpage" view -- which somewhat defeats the purpose of having a webpage editor in the first place.,3,08/06/2016,4

App822,org.wordpress.android,Extremely buggy. The text editor is flawed and it should not be. You know that's sort of important for a blogging app.,1,08/21/2016,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,App lacks a lot of basics when trying to write a post (font alignment options and such) which is annoying.

App822,org.wordpress.android,Can you please fix or explain why the new post editor strips all the captions I have written for images? Update 2/7: contacted support team _  no response. Your editor is stripping HTML that was previously fine and does not even display captions anymore. Posting images is also extremely clunky and I am not sure how to get multiple images to appear side by side anymore. The new version is a regression.

App822,org.wordpress.android,The web version of WordPress doesn't share consistently. Pictures are taken from my file and applied to random articles without warning.

App822,org.wordpress.android,Warning! Don't use this app to write your posts. Safer to write them elsewhere and then copy paste and upload _  which essentially you could do using just the website so it renders the app pretty useless. I have lost hours of work on a blog post _  all my text from the post disappeared (not sure what I pressed) then I pressed the back button on my tablet and the app saved my new (blank) post. No option to restore a previous version as all my work was done offline as local draft. Not safe to work on this alone!,1,07/01/2016,14

App822,org.wordpress.android,Since the update some of my words are typed twice when I press the space bar on my keyboard. It seems to happen at random but only happens in the WordPress app and only since the update. This is very irritating as I cannot get through a sentence without having to edit my typing. Also _  it'd be great if posts didn't automatically try to refresh and only show the most recent few when I open the app as it makes it a pain to go back to older posts as I have to re-download them taking too much time and using too much data.,2,06/29/2016,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,It now uploads media before you can edit things like post category and tags. PLEASE let me done everything I need to for the post and THEN upload when and publish when I'm ready. I now need to wait around instead of posting a photo and hitting go.,2,07/09/2016,3

App822,org.wordpress.android,I've been blogging for almost 4 years now and I am so glad I came upon Wordpress. It is convenient and easy to use. When I don't have time to post through my laptop _  I used this app for posting and it sure makes everything convenient. I can also see my daily stats everyday through this app without logging on to my computer. Good job! :),5,09/13/2016,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I love wordpress on the desktop. On my pc I can access my site easily. But the app refuses to allow me to sign in. It tells me my login information is wrong _  yet I can sign in just fine on my other PCs. Not sure what the issue is with the app _  but I am forced to use my mobile browsers to use Wordpress on my phone _  which is a shame. I will change my rating if I can find a solution to the problem.,1,06/07/2016,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,The app is great for quick posts and basic navigation but I find it incredibly frustrating  picture uploads seem to be impossible! I'd suggest an update to allow photo uploads.. otherwise not terrible.,3,06/05/2016,6
App822,org.wordpress.android,I've repeatedly clicked on the "select image" button _  but still _  no dialogs or whatsoever appears _  I need to enhance my site _  but I can't upload a single picture to change my header _  Id love to suggest u to fix this asap _  anyw good app! I love it! I love how it is minimalist! No regrets!!,4,06/03/2016,5
App822,org.wordpress.android,I find the app useful for basic editing _  perhaps making minor updates to articles; but for real functionality you need the browser portal.,4,06/07/2016,5
App822,org.wordpress.android,It won't sign me in. Likely because I renamed /wp-admin because I didn't want it to be so obvious that I was using WordPress as a CMS. However _  the app should account for that and allow me to specify my admin panel pathing. 0/10.,1,06/03/2016,8
App822,org.wordpress.android,Can't upload media from my galary ever after trying several times. Very disappointed wordpress.,2,06/19/2016,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Don't use the app much. I forgot my username _   password _  etc. They require too much information from to login.  Never saw or given the opportunity to go "Contact Us".,1,06/08/2016,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Add some features such as comment sorting according to date posted and more to make other people notice the new comment. Thank you!,4,06/03/2016,6

App822,org.wordpress.android,Nice app!  Sometimes after updating this app _  it takes time to log in again. It would be better if you would Please add few more (Indian) fonts.,3,06/07/2016,3
App822,org.wordpress.android,I have a paid WordPress site _  with hosting through ehost. I Log on 3-4 times a day..! I know my password isn't invalid. . Can someone tell me what's going on..   thanks for the reply about to do that now..,5,06/08/2016,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,I recently started blogging and this app refuses to let me sign in. I've changed my password like 8 times.,1,06/09/2016,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,It's cool and awesome. But break (read more) function is missing. I can't find it on the mobile. Bring it back,4,06/14/2016,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Generally okay if a bit confusing. But if I publish posts through the app the stats say no one has read it (when I know for certain people have). This leaves me with no accurate way of knowing how many people have read the post. Also if I save a draft and publish a few days later it says I published when I saved the original draft. I use Wordpress for professional purposes so both of these things are extremely annoying and not worth the hassle. Stick to the internet website.,2,06/10/2016,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Even though I save any post as a draft _  people can still see the post. That just totally defies the whole purpose. Please look into it.,4,06/13/2016,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,Though I don't use wordpress mobile for penning new blogs _  it is great way to read blogs and keep a check on the updates in my blogs. I have to say that the application has improved over the time and I can hardly find any fault with the app.,5,06/04/2016,3
App822,org.wordpress.android,Really not happy. Just typed out a post and scheduled it. It's now vanished and I can't get it back. Also _  Instead of giving us useless features _   why not allow us to have multiple accounts set up?  It's the one feature majority of users need. With apps like wordpress being used for business as well as personal blogs _   surely this feature should be essential?,2,09/04/2016,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,May I suggest adding a search button so that it is easier to find older posts if there is a need to update?,3,06/01/2016,10
App822,org.wordpress.android,I have issue with log in/log out. Every time I open the app it says that I have entered wrong username and password. And asks me to log in again. And sometimes it is showing error and doesn't let me to log in for 20 mins. It is so annoying. I can't track my website in time! 3 stars until it's fixed.,3,06/01/2016,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,I love the idea of the app it's great and I can't wait to use it but it's very buggy! Especially when it comes to uploading pictures. I'm on a Galaxy s6 so my phone is compatible. Please fix this as soon as possible!,3,06/02/2016,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,I cant edit widgets nor delete it even after the update. Spacing is also a problem _  I want a new paragraph but it connects to the previous one. Hate it until its fixed.,1,06/02/2016,1

App822,org.wordpress.android,It does what I want it to do. That's all I really need of any app.,5,05/30/2016,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I erased and image and it literally cleared all i have written and there is no undo button. Sometime when i click on bold and italics and write something when i unclick both of them the italics leave the written word and leaves just only the bold p.s you need to add a copy link of post button and an undo button. I also realise it cant upload most images that are a bit large then it says error..sometimes the bold button keeps activating itself after deactivating,3,06/06/2016,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,As a way of putting together posts on a phone _  this is a great app to have. It doesn't handle intermittent internet connections well at all though. The handling for syncing _  especially images needs work. I've lost work a few times due to this. At the moment it's best to put in placeholder text for images while working on a post _  and then later putting in all images when you have a stable net connection.,3,05/17/2016,3
App822,org.wordpress.android,Every post I write is accompanied with extra hours of redos _  redrafts _  and rewriting as the site seems to pick and choose what to keep when you hit save draft. The application never ever works without several bugs to work around. Uninstalling _  logging out _  force stopping _  nothing works. Can't wait to switch to Squarespace.,2,05/16/2016,22
App822,org.wordpress.android,On the whole this is an easy app to use and creates a nice clean blog using the default Chateau template.  However it doesn't seem to want to let me add pictures from my android phone gallery.  If there is a way to do it _  it must be rather convoluted and byzantine _  because nothing I have tried seems to work.  I can do it from my laptop _  but not from my Galaxy S6 Edge plus.  (Edit) - Just found a way to add photos - but still cannot do it while I'm writing the post.  I have to add to the media library before I start the post.,3,05/21/2016,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I was working with a beta version which started to lag and hang. When I removed the beta this problem was tackled. But since a couple of weeks the app has started lagging _  hanging and crashing again. I am very unhappy about this as I am now unable to use an app that worked very well.,1,05/30/2016,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,I have followed the help suggestions. No joy. Even at reduced size my image upload crashes my phone.Its so frustrating. All other apps upload images without problems,1,05/27/2016,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,Comments don't load anymore.. Not sure if WordPress update broke it _  or app update broke it.. Have 5 WordPress self hosted sites _  no comments load. Please fix this.              Comments still broken _  can't add multiple self hosted anymore _  after adding 1 all others say error. Almost everything is breaking for self hosted WordPress sites with this app. Hope it gets fixed _  used to be great app.,3,05/14/2016,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Says _  "Posts cannot be refreshed at this time". Same for Pages and Media. I cannot add anything new either. Please update as I would love to be able to use this app to blog during my summer travels.,1,05/28/2016,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I hope you Wordpress guys read this because this is getting horrible. Writing an article is ok although a bit limited _  but once you press the Pubish button havoc begins. First my Samsung Galaxy Note completely locks up _  then apparently it cannot handle the stress anymore and just reboots. And this happens EVERY time i post something more than a one-liner with an image. More then one image difficult _  video impossible. I upload only via Wifi.  Please debug this thing or crate something that works.,2,05/24/2016,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,It takes several tries to publish. The majority of attempts result in a soft boot. It also loses the draft that is supposedly saved. Rewrites of the same post over and over is lame. This is all on a Nexus 6p with the latest marshmallow.,2,05/08/2016,3
App822,org.wordpress.android,This is a great app.  The website still has a lot of functions the app doesn't have _  which is strange because I'm using the website on my android device.  Very nice design though.,4,05/31/2016,31
App822,org.wordpress.android,Seems good looks good but go to upload a header and the view files page doesn't open. Maybe I will start a blog about all the useless apps out there all afternoon uninstalling an app to get it to work it's happening on my Galaxy S6 also my Galaxy Tab 2 total rubbish no support,1,05/30/2016,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Edits made in the app simply do not save. If you try to report this error _  all they do is refer you to a forum and then recommend uninstalling and reinstalling the app.,1,05/16/2016,18
App822,org.wordpress.android,Can't login to my work site. Giving me error message. I login via my web browser without issues,1,05/19/2016,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I love WordPress no doubt but the application is just not right. It lags so much. It gets stuck after every second. You definitely cannot work using this application! Uninstalling it right away,1,05/21/2016,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I wrote an article and was saving it for later and then got a new phone and logged in and the article was deleted. Only stored locally? Come on wordpress. I logged into my account _  I should have all my drafts. Do they do much for the community of users also because I have only had 3 followers in 3 years. They should feature well-working websites. Also _  I cannot figure out how to do a sub category link from the main links. It goes dead. I will keep researching but some of it can be frustrating.,3,05/26/2016,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,After I update the app _  my drafts was lost... Hiks. I put my important article draft there. I don't know this could happen.,2,05/09/2016,50
App822,org.wordpress.android,I like that..i can create many blog with just 1 email with this app..And i also ove that i can make my blog like it was made by computer sort of...and yeah..all beginner should try this app! Really cool..but yeah some problem like cant use the multiple pick for choosing more than 1 image for my entry/blog.....so its kinda hard..has to pick 1 by 1 ....,4,05/21/2016,4
App822,org.wordpress.android,I have two WordPress accounts for two separate blogs. I wish I can use them both in one app without having to sign in and out again. If that can be made possible _  I'll rate this 5 stars. Also I wish I can edit a lot more settings while posting in the app: sharing settings _  featured image _  etc.,4,05/17/2016,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,In the new version _  I can't chose if the image can be used as featured image or not or to appear in the post or not. I wish I can revert back to the previous version _  I'd be better.,1,05/16/2016,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,Great for basic WordPress function. but I wish page editing was not just HTML but had visual editing as well. Would make thinks a lot easier for a quick edit.,3,05/26/2016,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,I love this app....my life has always been crzy and thru WordPress I am able to live and function by releasing my daily struggles. This app is easy and I'd give It a 10 if I could.,5,05/19/2016,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I use it a lot but the app is broken on my S6. Launches to frozen page,4,05/06/2016,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,Just want to say _  I love WordPress and the app. But it would be really cool if there was a feature to have multiple accounts logged in at the same time so you could switch from site to site you know?,5,05/17/2016,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,Awful. Used on self hosted site with good database but app gave nothing but refresh errors _  permission errors _  upload errors. Wouldn't load images either.,1,05/15/2016,3
App822,org.wordpress.android,Why cannot I upload Images now. I keep tapping the upload media option but nothing happens. Kindly fix the issue for ( Samsung Note 5 _ os 6.0.1,2,05/11/2016,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,Lately it's not keeping me signed in. I check the box for "stay signed in" but it constantly has me log back in. Also when editing my menus from the app while on my phone _  as soon as I try to drag a page to reorder the menu it automatically scrolls all the way down making it impossible. Please fix these issues and thanks.,2,05/27/2016,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,This is a very good app. But after the recent update (some days back) I can't see the STATS widget. That was really helpful. But now I have to go to the app and check my stats there. I am giving 4 stars just because you guys removed the widget _  else this is a 5 star app.,4,03/30/2016,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I couldn't get it to upload media at first but I narrowed down the problem.  It's not file size but dimension. Everything below 2 _ 000 pixels uploads fine _  I haven't tested anything larger. Just posting this in case you had the same problem _  use an image resizer app.,4,03/20/2016,35
App822,org.wordpress.android,I love Wordpress _  but the mobile app truly sucks. It's so difficult to use _  and very limitedbon what you can do. Can't figure out how to change password _  how to search for bloggers or how to physically post something after I've written it. Would rather use desktop version of Wordpress _  and just use the app to check stats.,1,03/23/2016,6
App822,org.wordpress.android,I'm unable to update my self hosted WordPress website from mobile because Select Media button is not working _  same problem was in previous release _  after update I thought that it might be resolved but no improvement. When I install app for first time everything was good and working so I suggest same to my client's _  but no solution after updates 3 times yet.,1,04/03/2016,3
App822,org.wordpress.android,This ap let's you keep tabs on your blog stats _  traffic _ and comments pretty decently.  You can change your post status which I have found helpful at times. Only real problem I've had is trying to edit previously published blogs - doesn't seem to like anything but plain text and I lose content and readability when trying to make even minor corrections to posts with pictures _  bolding _  etc.,4,03/21/2016,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,I'd consider myself a fairly light user _  just want to do text and pics with captions on my phone as I have no PC access. Adding the pics is a nightmare: I've lately been using the multiple picker _  but it doesn't recognise albums _  and its very clumsy to scroll through thousands of pics. Have a workaround for that _  but then changing btw apps or just scrolling up and down in editing mode results in a crash sooner or later. At my wits ends. I refuse to add pics one by one in the media library...,3,03/21/2016,3
App822,org.wordpress.android,Nice app for writing blog posts on the go _  checking out stats _  catching up on the reader.  Haven't tried adding artwork.  A somewhat annoying bug: my views of my own blog from the app get counted in stats.,4,03/16/2016,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,I am loving this app. Only problem is that I can't upload media to a post I just finished writing.  I want to publish it but can't yet as I don't have any pictures or media on it. Please help.,4,03/22/2016,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,After a year of use this app still doesn't work. It wont save uploaded photos _  it removes posts and often wont upload until the 15th try. Way to many bugs. Have to use the web page (even though the web page version is painfully slow),2,03/20/2016,6
App822,org.wordpress.android,There is no option to publish my article in the app anymore. I have to go on my PC to post a blog online _  I never had this issue before and love this app now this is just inconvenient plz fix this now,2,03/22/2016,14

App822,org.wordpress.android,Really makes it easy and fun to get back into writing and start blogging _   which I have always wanted to do.  Super easy interface _  and simple to understand and use.,5,03/15/2016,9
App822,org.wordpress.android,How people rate this app so highly is beyond me. This is simply one of the most awful apps out there. The interface is muddled and feels like an alpha. Going to admin is just a browser window that doesn't work as well as your browser. It has quite possibly the worst editor I've ever seen. You're better off just logging in with a browser than wasting your time on this. This is a half baked broken app. It's a good thing they don't force Android users to use the app like Evernote does _  because this is atrocious. Just log in with your browser and use the web interface because its infinitely better than this.,1,03/30/2016,3
App822,org.wordpress.android,It's alright but crashes sometimes. Some parts are easier to use than directly in the web client such as looking at site statistics.,4,03/24/2016,0

I've contact WordPress about this bug before and was told to update _  which I've done twice since and nothing has changed. I'm moving to a different blog provider. Pathetic!,1,03/13/2016,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,Tried updating my post by adding pics to it using the app _  and it failed _  twice.

App822,org.wordpress.android,I really like this app because it allows me to edit posts when off line _  putting changes through when logged into a network. However _  it seems to not keep in sync with work done on my desk top. Logged into my desk top or portable device will get me different results _  even though both should be synced _  that shouldn't matter _  right-of both devices go on line and are edited on the same account? I'm pretty sure that I've been saving my changes. Anyhow _  thank you for this application. I like  the themes.,4,02/24/2016,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Awesome app _  very user friendly _  but I would like to be able to add featured images to posts. That's the one thing I miss from the web version _  since my blog features an image in every post so I have to go back and edit any I write using this app.,4,03/04/2016,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Not much use - very disappointing.  You log into your 'self-hosted' site and none of the in-app functionality seems to work. 'Couldn't refresh at this time' keeps being shown. Instead you need to view the website and then use the normal dashboard _  but on a small screen. I could do that in any browser.  Please fix the refresh issue.,1,02/26/2016,13
App822,org.wordpress.android,I downloaded this hoping it would be a good outlet for posting things I write. Unfortunately this app forces you to keep every line you write extremely short _  like 3 or 4 words before it bumps you to the next line. I have more room on this review than I did on their app. Totally screws up rythem _  grammer _  pacing _  feel _  and sound. Bad app for writers.,2,02/13/2016,22
App822,org.wordpress.android,This app has used 750MB of mobile data in 10 days and I haven't even used it very much - and I usually use it on WiFi anyway! It's a very nice app but there is something wrong with the data usage.,2,03/22/2016,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I use the app frequently to write while I am traveling. I just spent an hour to compose an article. I needed to check a link on chrome and went back to the main menu. It said local draft saved. I looked up what I needed and went back into the app. In the preview the pictures have been scrambled with the text _  an issue I had observed already _  which I did not really care about that much. When I tried to edit it _  there was no more content _  everything gone except for the heading. Everything was deleted.,2,02/14/2016,4
App822,org.wordpress.android,After installing this app I had nothing but problems. With my self hosted site. Wouldn't upload media in posts. Wouldn't log in properly.

App822,org.wordpress.android,This app keeps deleting my drafts and I had to type the same stuff Oover and over again. It also deletes my pictures non-stop and I had to insert and insert until I get mad. Please fix this,2,02/15/2016,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,The customization tool SUCKS. I can't change the photo on my cover page and (while it is a decent picture of snowy mountains) I live in a desert so it doesn't make much sense. I also can't change the font color...which is stupid since I can change the background and want to use a dark color to prevent eyestrain. But I don't want to pay for the "premium package". Ugh.... EDIT: I am so sorry that it took so long to catch what my autocorrect did. Wow.,2,03/27/2018,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,This app is ok. The end results can be great if you are patient _  but the whole interface is just painful _  and I end up putting off updating my blog because I know it is going to be a hassle. There seem to be so many different areas to the app _  all of which allow you to edit a post for example _  but each with a slightly different interface and different features and options. Yesterday I was previewing a post _  found a mistake so clicked edit and went into a completely different editor _  which allowed media insertion direct from hard drive rather than having to upload to library first. And now I can't find it. Could be great but is too messy and bitty. Typical piece of software written by a large company with lots of developers who don't talk to each other _  and no one person with an overview of what it is really like to use.,3,02/23/2016,18
App822,org.wordpress.android,I love this app. But when I want to edit a draft _  it shows in html format _  which is very inconvenient.  Solve this issue and you will get 5 stars for this awesome blogging platform.,4,02/11/2016,17

App822,org.wordpress.android,I would have thought WordPress had more skills than this! I'm deleting this app because it sucks.,1,01/30/2016,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,Here are the problems with this app on my Nexus 7: I can't upload photos through the app. I have to use the browser version and upload one at a time. Very annoying if I want to put 20-30 photos in a post. If the orientation of my tablet changes _  the app resets to the dashboard and you lose what you were working on. The cursor sometimes behaves very strangely when typing _  so you end up with one word insianotherde _  like that. All of these things make creating a post a slow and frustrating process.,2,01/24/2016,7
App822,org.wordpress.android,No plugin or tools support _  unable to get access to edit any "post installation" tools or plugins. Only able to edit pages and posts. Would suit a blogger only at this point. Looking forward to future updates as the ui is nice.,3,01/12/2016,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,As far as tailoring posts is concerned _  there is actually far less that you can do on the app than on the website. But if you simply need a quick way to receive notifications _  comment and just make quick drafts _  you might find this quite useful.,3,02/07/2016,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,The new UI is nice _  but once I updated _  I can no longer see the app in my drawer. I can only access the app from Google Play store.  UPDATE: I restarted my phone and got the shortcut back _  just as Automattic _  Inc. suggested. Thanks for the reply!,5,02/09/2016,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,-then I don't know what is. Perfectly fine cyberweb space creation tool kit. Maybe it is because I am just so familiar with the setup _  or maybe I am too afraid of the other sites that offer their own variations. But I just keep coming back. The app ran wonky on my old phone. But my old phone was wonky anyway. Here's to the new. &lt;3 ¬¢\{^.^`}¬¢\,5,01/19/2016,18
App822,org.wordpress.android,1. It doesn't display scheduled blog posts 2. Once the scheduled blog post is already published _  it doesn't reflect on the app immediately _  in fact it takes ages. 3. Too limited in terms of feature access. 4. Takes toooo long to reflect changes.,2,01/22/2016,1

App822,org.wordpress.android,Private or password locked function does not work when you tap on 'view blog posts'.

It would be nice if there's a filter as well and if there's an index tab for us to easily search what we are looking for _  just like in the desktop website.  Hope it can apply as well n the app.  Thanks. :),4,01/25/2016,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,I've just used a little just now. And I found that on website _  you guys have "open in new tab" feature when we add a link on text _  so that users clicked on it _  the link opens in a new tab. But in app _  there is no such a feature. I had to copy the html code from the previous link I've created using web version (on PC). That's not such a big deal. But I think you guys should add that feature in app too.,3,01/27/2016,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,I have two blogs and I can't seem to log in both of them. This was not a problem in the earliest version that I used.

App822,org.wordpress.android,Online and in mobile I'm asked for a verification code _  but I never receive it. It refers to an authenticator mobile application _  which I can't find. What's even more amusing is that the online help requires me to login with this code before makingr a help request... So I'm unable to use my account _  or get help. Interestingly enough _  the rest password sends me a mail to my email address.,1,12/22/2015,3

App822,org.wordpress.android,Beats the purpose if website is where you have to go to access tags and home. The app only shows blogposts in the order of them being updated. Need to be able to see tags and home page of a blog in the app instead of just blogposts,3,12/29/2015,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I'm quite satisfied of the blog as a customer _  but as an admin the site is awful. When I want to copy some of my text or even write a new page or article _  the first screen thumbtouch engaging keypad _  it goes to top page? When I want to change for example title menu it refresh for each single letter??? And there are few problems which i'm also not entirely satisfied. Can you fix it please? This app doesn't fit on android phone _  moreover since nothing has been fixed _  I changed to 1 star,2,12/23/2015,6
App822,org.wordpress.android,Hey WordPress team. Love the interface. However _  whenever I try to edit my drafts via mobile app _  my drafts seem to be filled with HTML elements. This really makes it rather unsatisfactory. Hope to hear from you soon.,3,01/09/2016,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,I don't know if this happens to anyone else _  but for me it continuously makes me sign in. I can understand signing in again after an hour or so of inactivity. Even 30 minutes. However _  I have to relogin after 5-10 minutes of inactivity! Maybe even less than five minutes! For instance _  I'll type a draft and save it. I'll go to another app and come back to Wordpress within 5 minutes and it makes me sign in again. It's very irritating. Also _  I can't seem to post media on this app.,2,11/28/2015,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,1) it's missing a search field.  2) no multi select and upload of multiple images from a single folder _  it's either messy all together or one by one. 3) I lost the whole text and images of a new post because of an internet connection error _  this should not happen no matter how bad the connection is _  offline editing is what users expect from an application vs the web-admin! 4) post settings button is hidden when keyboard is open 5) can't edit site url 6) can't batch upload local charges,3,11/18/2015,11

App822,org.wordpress.android,Great app but one problem: can't share in a Facebook page. You can only share on your own wall _  on a friend's wall and in a group. Used to be able to share in a page but for some reasons we can't do that now. Please fix as soon as possible,4,11/16/2015,2

App822,org.wordpress.android,While this is a handy app for on-the-go posting or editing _  the stats are not very useful. For example _  although it's nice to show that I had 905 hits from the UK or US _  the fact that I cannot see which state or city within the countries listed _  or even more importantly _  the breakdown of the actual pages/titles for those area makes the stats useless. I recommend bookmarking your Google analytics page instead...,3,11/14/2015,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,The app has got very good options to add an image with your write up or multiple images or to change the theme or background while it also gives an option to share your write ups on various sites which helps increase the readership and the likes and comments on the blog. The only thing that should not be there is the ads that pop up when someone opens the link of our write up which is kind of distractive.,4,11/02/2015,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,It shows how much like the posts get but it shows also users which doesn't look beautiful under the post with some little image of users who like posts. Its irritable. Will give 5 star if wordpress can fix it!,2,10/31/2015,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,This app helps do quick posting of pictures and blog entries on website and much more. Also extremely great customer service.

App822,org.wordpress.android,So wordpress decided to log me oit a few days back and that's it. No matter how many times I try it won't log me back in.

App822,org.wordpress.android,...do you NOT allow me to log in even though my password is correct? Sure i get to log in for a few SECONDS then *poof!* you log me out again! Why?! AND!!!

And there's even NO media attached! *SOB!* and to think I was gonna restart my love for blogging &gt;_&lt;,1,10/25/2015,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,i am a heavy wordpress user and for months now I noticed that whenever I update _  the content goes on to html view. I cant update my blogs normally on my phone. very frustrating. the updates suck. fix the gui first.,1,10/25/2015,10
App822,org.wordpress.android,This is an awkward _  buggy _  un-user friendly mess-- but the blogs I follow are WordPress-- so I plow on. Reader NEVER works right _  won't let me read comments _  add comments _  or "like" a blog entry-- so I wind up using my browser anyway. The blog themes and settings are cumbersome as well _  and just as buggy.,2,11/04/2015,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,Was able to connect to my personally hosted blog. Everything looks pretty good _  but the Featured Image setting doesn't work. I add an image from my Media Library _  then edit its properties...Check the box for "Featured Image" and then leave the box for "Show in post" unchecked _  but it always just shows the image in the post and refuses to set it as the Featured image _  no matter how many times I go back and try to edit it/redo it.   Unfortunately _  that was the main function I was hoping to use _  so pretty worthless to me.,3,11/06/2015,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Sends a publish event which posts to Twitter even though it's an update to a post and not a new one. Web interface works fine _  and so did the last version of the app.,1,10/23/2015,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I use this app to blog while working full time and I can no longer broadcast posts using the app on my phone. Constantly coming up with a server error but I've had it checked! Very annoyed. Why work for months then suddenly stop? What am I missing. Also regularly only saves changes as local changes rather than uploading to the server!,3,11/09/2015,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,For me this is an important feature as i like to record where it is i've been traveling. Still buried and can't default to on slightly buried the new  set up doesn't work with postcodes and wont let me view a map to confirm correct location. Why not use a small map and overlay crosshairs to allow confirmation or manual alteration?,2,10/26/2015,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,Great app _  but please modify the app to make it smoother for your phone and actually LIKE an app. What I mean is that the app is identical to the mobile version of WordPress on Chrome (or any other mobile browser). I downloaded the app for convenience and a smoother UI _  but it's the exact same as the website. Please modify the app so it's more like an actual APP. Otherwise that _  4 stars.,4,10/22/2015,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,Why was WordPress came as app? Previous version was quite simple _  easy and worked for mobile with even 2G. You know the facts about mobile internet speeds. The newer version has many cons. Please remove image preview under each post listing as it takes much time for me to navigate to Older post even when I am on WiFi _  it doesn't even load on mobile with 2G or 3G. Graphically its good but ground reality is that I have stop accessing my sites from WordPress mobile app. I Rolled back to Older Version via APK.,3,10/09/2015,3
App822,org.wordpress.android,Almost didn't bother downloading based on a lot of negative reviews on here _  but I'm glad I did. I could never use the browser on my phone to post because the formatting got all out of whack - but it works great through the app! Also if I paste a poem it actually keeps the indents where I want them _  which I haven't even gotten to work when posting via desktop computer.,4,10/19/2015,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I didn't say hate it _  because it is sort of cool _  but it takes FOREVER to get signed in. And if you are not English or whatever _  you can't eve change the language. My advice please don't get it _  or else you will have to change your sign up sheet 10 times.,2,10/08/2015,3
App822,org.wordpress.android,Very impressed by this app. I used Blogger first and expected them to be similar _  but I think Blogger is years behind due to a lack of attention from Google. There's a lot of potential with this app _  how editing a website from mobile should be.,4,10/02/2015,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Liked the app prior to last update. Ever since _  can't sign in & no explanations or error msg. Just keeps popping back to sign in screen. Tried clearing data & uninstall/reinstall with no luck. What's the problem?  Happens with both my blogs & no matter which device I try.,3,10/05/2015,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,It keeps deleting my posts _  and costing me a  ton of time. I'm not sure why but it's done this TWICE now. Not sure I can continue to use word press to blog because of these awful issues,1,10/04/2015,7

App822,org.wordpress.android,This used to be a really nice app until I got the latest update. It's slow _  loads very few posts on the reader and when it hangs while I'm using it _  other people can't access my site! I simply hate and I advice you not to update your app if your still using the old version.  . . Oh _  and another thing _  you can't view all your followers and the stats area is just complicated and useless. They have also removed the widgets area,1,10/18/2015,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,WordPress has been sort of a nightmare for us for a number of reasons. We have spent hours and hours writing posts only to have them deleted when we try to add photos. Some versions over the last months have uploaded all photos in a blog post over and over when half have already been uploaded. This had been a nightmare when visiting places with poor internet. Now we made the mistake of logging out and when we login _  self hosted blog will not come up. We are trying to put up the final post for a 4200km hike!,2,10/10/2015,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,The app is fine for getting a quick update of your stats _  but I'm finding it is quite buggy for making posts. Produces and error when adding images and sometimes loses whole posts.,3,10/17/2015,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,This app is absolutely horrific. It is so confusing. The website itself is pretty awful but the app is terrible. It is not user friendly at all. I am 20 years old and use new technology every single day for my major and job. My college recently made students create a WordPress blog and post as homework. I have not met one single student who even remotely enjoys the website. There is a reason nobody I know used WordPress until it became mandatory. I hate every minute of using this website and app.,1,10/19/2015,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Note 4: When working within the wordpress app _  the visual editor options are limited.  I need control over aligning my text.  If I want to center a title and then left align the cursor to begin my writing _  there is no option available.  If I go through the web _  all the text options appear.  I need access to alignments and justifications in the visual editor tool box on the application _  not just through the web.  I've read up on something called kitchen sink but I cannot apply it to the app on my note 4.,3,10/05/2015,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I can't count how many times I've spent hours writing a post only to have it vanish just because I rotate to screen from vertical to  horizontal. WHY DOES THE APP REFRESH JUST BECAUSE THE ORIENTATION OF MY PHONE CHANGES???? So sad that such a powerhouse such as WordPress puts their reputation on such a terrible app. Fix the orientation issue please.,2,10/11/2015,1

App822,org.wordpress.android,Avoid this app if you're an on the go photographer that posts images from your DSLR. I can't even get this app to upload an image period.

App822,org.wordpress.android,I think the biggest problem with WordPress is the lack of optimization services.

App822,org.wordpress.android,This app saved a different version of one of my posts than I had saved on WordPress on my computer. I published my article on my phone and an unfinished version of the post was published. I lost the rest of my article. I'm in tears as I was supposed to release my website today but will have to wait until a reasonable time tomorrow if I'm not working too much that is.,1,09/08/2015,1

App822,org.wordpress.android,Having to search for blogs via tags or url is ridiculous.

App822,org.wordpress.android,The WordPress app does everything I want it too. My only small gripe is that when I'm writing a post I would like some feature to be able to access my media so I can insert pictures into my posts other than uploading them every time.,4,08/17/2015,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,I can not repost from the follows I once was able to do in the old version. So I am removing this app entirely. I always told people not to upgrade because the upgrades have usually turned out to suck greatly. Not at all impressed. Over it.,1,08/30/2015,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,I've been travelling and thought this would be an ideal tool to blog off line as I travelled. Don't try it.

Developers eventually admitted it was a bug but aren't bothered enough to fix it before the next major version.,1,07/28/2015,6
App822,org.wordpress.android,The app itself is somewhat aesthetically pleasing but is extremely awkward to use on my Android. I'm having trouble scrolling up and down _  let alone being able to post anything to my blog. Definitely not worth installing - stick to the desktop version.,2,08/04/2015,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,One of the major attractions this app has for me is the ability to write offline posts. However _  two bugs make it completely unusable for that purpose. First of all _  adding images offline and then reopening the post with an active internet connection removes all the images. Second _  if the internet connection fails during a post upload (eg one with 30 images) _  the whole upload hangs _  the app has to be force closed and then the upload restarted from scratch... This has litteraly cost me hours of my time.,3,08/04/2015,0

I'm new to WP and intend to write more _  so please fix these asap.,2,08/04/2015,1

App822,org.wordpress.android,Since a new update the option to reblog a post from another blog I follow is not available. Or am I missing something.  I use a Note 4 . How do I reblog it's driving me mad .             Since I last updated the app I can no longer add pics or compose and send a post without getting an upload error message.   It really ia not good enough. I run a successful blog but am finding it harder and harder to do . Please fix this issue. Others have mentioned it so please reply.,2,07/24/2015,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,The new update works great and more handy to use! I use this app to monitor my sites stats and to publish new post occasionally. Even though i had login issue with the previous update _  hats off to developer the problem is now solved!! Thanks!!,5,07/22/2015,2

App822,org.wordpress.android,I'm a little put off that this app is only a fraction of the experience you get on a mobile browser. It's not even a similar experience to the already-unnecessarily-complicated one you get in WordPress _  rendering it unintuitive. You can't even do basic things like set the feature image. It's almost insulting that there's a way to access the admin dashboard through the app _  which literally just opens the mobile WordPress in an in-app browser. From there you can still access all WordPress features. So why...,2,07/25/2015,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I can't login to my blog through the app.  The "contact us" option throws an error.  Why did this make it through QA?  Super fast update resolved it. Kudos!,5,07/22/2015,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,This is a great app _  but the latest update 4.3 messed up. Notifications _  werent updating _  reblog and like buttons were gone _  and the contact function didnt work so couldnt even report the issues. Left a message here which seems to have disappeared _  butsince then have read about the 4.3.1 update _  and IT SOLVES ALL THE ISSUES! Immediately! So give it a try. I wish Automattic would have sent out the update automatically (pardon the pun!) to save us all this grief.,5,07/25/2015,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Very good apps. Come in handy _  light _  easy to use and exploring wordpress sites. But still has something to do for blog posting. Provide more advanced text editor,5,07/22/2015,2

App822,org.wordpress.android,If there is one I can't find it. While using the app on samsung galaxy note 3 _   a botched copy and paste attempt resulted in an entire post disappearing. Very infuriating!! Will never write a draft in this app again.  Will write it elsewhere then transfer in.  Plus it won't upload my video. Says I need to update video press. Even after I updated the wordpress app.  Why isn't everything included in one app.?  Update: July 22 2015 just installed an update and now I can't see recent comments on the app feed.,3,07/22/2015,0

It's very fluid and responsive and appears to provide almost all of the function of the online site! Good for people that always want to keep an eye on their blog.,5,07/14/2015,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Shows only 2 out of my posts! Where are all others? Then _  trying to open a post _  another error. Won't open the site at all with stupid security message. Totally unusable now. Not even 5%. Not even viewing postes. Why put a non working app on google play? Why misleading the users?,1,07/17/2015,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,Keeps going back to main page when I am on the dashboard. Not user friendly. Everytime I try it on my phone I prefer opening the laptop and making my WordPress experience less frustrating. The PC version is sleek.,2,07/08/2015,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,The app is amazing but the latest update has made it really tough to publish a post _  I have even faced deletion of a few of my writings. Please see to your application and the problems.,4,07/18/2015,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,Spent an hour writing a blog. I attached 1 small video and 7 pictures. Clicked upload and 5sec later phone was sluggish and unresponsive.  An hour later on ultra high-speed Korean 4g LTE+ _  the phone was still unresponsive and the app still said uploading.  Had to restart phone. Went back to app _  clicked local copy then edit. Blog was there for 3sec then went blank. Had to rewrite. Same issue again when I tried to post. 5hrs and 3 rewrites later _  blog was still not uploaded. Worst app I've ever delt with.,1,07/08/2015,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,Update to rating _  After getting help from customer support _  they were able to get me into my account was very fast with the response even after several attempts to get in _  until they worked out the problem. Now it's not an issue. . . . Tried many times to log in _  and I know the email and pass are correct _  however it says they aren't correct! So disappointing.,4,07/21/2015,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Worst app I have ever tried to use. It will not even let me upload _  all I get is an error message that I was not authorized to do that. I was able to upload to the site without the app so why not with the app. Would love to know.,1,07/16/2015,1

App822,org.wordpress.android,I love this app and it allows me to do a lot with all the sites that I manage.  There's is one major feature missing from the app and that's the ability to sync/backup the site list. Every time I have to reset my phone or I get a new device I have to manually add back all my self hosted websites.,3,07/20/2015,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I rely on this app to communicate. Wordpress itself is great _  but the app will delete an entire post _  losing me hours of time and energy _  if I back out or answer a call while the post is loading. It appears to do no cached versions _  so everything is lost. It doesn't even do a "you just said to save a blank post instead of the 1000 word 12 photo one you had _  is that on purpose?" I do save every once in a while _  but it doesnt matter with this issue _  it saves over. Back up your stuff on another app.,2,07/08/2015,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,I wish that I could give this negative 100 stars. I hate the set up I hate you have to go through so much to get your drafts or posts synced to the desktop and I literally hate this app because my local draft just erased and now I can't get it back.,1,07/09/2015,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,Was very frustrating for first time use. If it turns out to be a learning curve _  I'll up the score. But it kept losing my text and freezing up when I tried adding an image. Took five tries to get it posted. Not happy right now.,2,07/05/2015,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,I wrote an entire post that took several hours on this application and when I published it _  it deleted the entire thing and published a completely blank post. I'm horribly annoyed and can't believe I ever wasted my time with such an awful blogging service.,1,07/03/2015,4

App822,org.wordpress.android,While everything else seems fine and functional with the newest version I've noticed that it shows my blog as having about 2099 posts while I have over 2200.  The comment counter is also far off and the categories.  It would be great to see this aligned properly for reference.  UPDATE: It's been over a year and some revisions that I pointed this out and its still not a rectified issue.  Now the blog has over 3100 posts and yet the app shows 3060.  Otherwise I really like this app as its quite helpful.,4,07/03/2015,13

App822,org.wordpress.android,I wanted to use this app so I could work on my blog on my phone. It would be easier to create thoughts in the moment when the inspiration hits even if I edited it later. However this app sucks. It used to be a good one where I could do so but now even when editing a post it rewrites words or letters I am using even though I am pressing delete! This really needs to be edited for it to be a user friendly site. Many people use wordpress for their blogs or websites so to me its unacceptable for it to be this hard.,1,01/20/2018,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,Tried this app off and on since it first appeared on the market... Using the web interface is still more intuitive & MUCH more reliable.

App822,org.wordpress.android,I would just LOVE to use this app _  but like other have said _  adding pics is just not a possibility. My tablet freezes completely everytime I try.  Also _  I can only save drafts locally OR publish them.  I would like to save them online without publishing them _  so I can add pics over the internet _  after writing with the app... but that is also a no go: making this app completely useless to me.  If I want to write when I am not online _  I can use a word-processer.,2,05/07/2015,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I use Wordpress as the site for my business and have always been happy with it _  but the latest update is absolute garbage. It now won't let me upload images from my tablet directly to my posts _  and if I try it crashes my device and I have to force close my other programmes and have to restart it. This has a big effect on my online work. Dreadful.,1,05/07/2015,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,I really love using WordPress for my blog _  but it's frustrating using the app to try and upload any images into a blog post. My tablet freezes completely when trying to add an image _ resulting in me having to restart it every time and not getting anywhere so I end up doing it on my desktop. The thought was to be able to post while I'm away from my computer but it's failing.,2,05/04/2015,5
App822,org.wordpress.android,I blog daily and I have been trying to improve my insights by adding my personal touch of my life and I tried adding some great diy photos and it keeps shutting my phone off and not publishing like its suppose to.

App822,org.wordpress.android,In general I was very happy with the app. Never caused problems and was fun to use.  Recently (probably after upgrade) uploading photos became an issue _  but for me the worst is that after two hours of writing a post offline I got online and instead of uploading _  the app just deleted everything!!!,2,05/10/2015,0

I always have to fix an article in my laptop or iPad.,1,05/01/2015,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I'm using a Samsung note 3. It won't allow me to select any images to upload.

Very difficult to switch between them.,1,05/02/2015,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,but shear horror if you want to upload images.Upload is interrupted most of the time leaves the local media cache completely broken.No easy upload of multiple images (workaround via filemanager share dialog) _  no progress bar on upload (no idea if finished _  incomplete or still working).Crashes if accidentally refresh media library during upload. Please devs _  add a decent way to upload images with progress info and feedback if it was successful or failed. Otherwise it's a real pain in the ass to use the  app.,1,04/30/2015,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,I spent an agonising hour with my tablet frozen from trying to upload a photo into my post.

App822,org.wordpress.android,As much as I would have loved rating wordpress 5stars _  the image wouldn't let me do that. Please help fix it as soon as possible. Havent been able to use it anymore effectively since I last updated it. Thanks,2,05/07/2015,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I really liked this app until I updated it. Now when I go to edit my blog page _  the side by side settings overlap each other _  making it unreadable.

I think I'll start looking for another blog app _  for when I get to frustrated with this one.,2,05/08/2015,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,I'm new to blog. but I can't sit in front of computer and do all blogging all the time. that's why I'm installing this.

I lost my drafted post because the site save the previous work.  so I have to rewrite my post on site once again.  what a waste! and another things please make the wp mobile menus exactly like the desktop menu. Such as caption of images should be centered _  right? But there is no such option on wp mobile. Pls fix. TY,2,04/26/2015,2

App822,org.wordpress.android,Makes it very easy to manage multiple blogs. But _  very limited configurations. Anything advanced in your posts or blog architecture is non-existant...simply must be done on your pc. This is a great app for basic posting and monitoring the stats for your blogs...but that's it.,3,05/09/2015,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,Update: the small issue I was having was resolved promptly. I am a big fan of this very good app. My original review was:  "The latest update is not helpful; my password doesn't save on my phone (HTC one m8) _  so every time I go to the app _  I have to log in again. Not a big deal for you _  maybe _  but having the brain injury I do makes this issue inconvenient enough to consider moving my blog to a different service altogether. Please fix this!",5,04/28/2015,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,Wordpress should stop fixing things that aren't broken. They went from the absolute finest blog platform to a sputtering _  smoking wreck at the rear of the pack. Simply attempting to insert an image into a post now completely locks up my tablet. Stop fixing things. Now I have to find a new blog platform. Bring back 3.8.,1,04/25/2015,2

App822,org.wordpress.android,Please let us insert images by URL with the app. It annoys me that I can't put images I've uploaded on external storage,3,04/25/2015,11
App822,org.wordpress.android,Since the last update I can't use my regular photo viewer to choose pictures from my post. I now have a list of images that seem to come from my tablet but not it's sd card; where all my images are. I have around 30 _ 000 images in various picture folders (I am travelling and have a 128GB sd card in my tablet where my images are stored)  and this update to 3.9 has made choosing images impossible.  I have two possible workarounds. Either I upload the images to google or similar and put a link in the post to them. Or my second option is to upload the images in the WordPress app through the media menu item and then choose these images I want in the post using your new chooser interface.  Honestly I see what you are trying to do with the new interface but it does limit the user as to how they choose their images. Handing this task over to the operating system _  as it was before _  makes more sense and makes your app lighter.  Please switch back to the normal way of adding images. Updating posts on tablets and phones has been great with the WordPress app and I feel it's just been made more difficult with this update.,2,04/27/2015,4

I do want to inform that this past week _  I've been having trouble viewing my site from the app. ADDING 04.13: I've had to use the live chat help a few times. They're great and patient with your concerns/technical issues. I was able to resolve my issues in record time.,4,04/14/2015,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,I just used this to perform a relatively simple task - edit a post and upload some images. The post editor showed all the markup for links _  formatting etc _  which looks messy and is hard to navigate. Worse still _  I wanted to upload more than one image _  which I wasn't given the option of. I had to upload each one separately and re-find the folder they were stored in each time _  which is time consuming and tedious. The mobile website is flawed _  but much better than this so I'll go back to that.,1,04/21/2015,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,Every time I try to add a photo to my post it hangs my tablet _  making the screen completely unresponsive and randomly changes the screen orientation even though tablet hasn't moved.

Not updating until I know everything is fixed!,1,04/23/2015,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,Was a great app _  however since the last update it is slow _  cannot view my site _  as soon as i try to create new gallery my tablet completely crashes.  I see others are having the same  problems _  so not one off.   Repair or roll-back please,3,04/19/2015,1

App822,org.wordpress.android,I have multiple wordpress blogs and when it works it's great but it consistently losses login info to one of my blogs so I'm constantly having to add it back and I've gotten no response about that from their support team. I've now recently lost the ability to use the app after signing into an account since it keeps throwing me in a loop to sign back in. I doubt I'll have this issue long if it's happening to more people but it seems they have consistent login issues they need to fix otherwise it's great!,3,04/19/2015,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,Am updating from rating from 1/5 to 3/5. WordPress has done a good job since the last time I used the app. But still leaving out search which is one of the most important features keeps me from giving it 4/5,1,04/19/2015,1

Once done and seeing the full text on the screen _  I backed out to the post listing _  clicked on my draft and to my despair _  only saw first few paragraphs saved. A rare free hour wasted. Now rewriting on the desktop,3,04/16/2015,2

App822,org.wordpress.android,I'm running version 3.8.1 _  and I really like the interface.  Improved utility _  too.  The previous problem of retrieving stats on only one blog seems to be fixed.  Occasionally I have to re-enter login information on the 2 other blogs - this seems to be a problem at the WP servers _  not with the app itself.  Good app _  and getting better.,4,03/25/2015,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,It is handy for a lot of things _  but if I edit a post between my 3 different devices _  I never know when the changes will stick or if I need to copy and paste to and from a different cloud document app to ensure I'm working with the most recent revision. Kind of defeats the purpose of this app,2,04/05/2015,2

App822,org.wordpress.android,I can't tell how good or bad this app is as it won't let me log in to my self hosted website. It doesn't recognise my details but they work when I log in on a web browser.  I'm hoping it is better than the last version _  which had random error messages when I tried to refresh any page (particularly the comments section).,1,04/05/2015,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,Year after year _  the same crap....I just spent 45 minutes working on a post. I pushed the button to publish _  and Wordpress immediately said it could not publish. (Not sure why _  b/c my internet connection is fine.) It didn't save the post _  the whole thing is gone _  up in smoke.   This app might be good for a Buddhist who wants to work on not being attached to his/her posts _  but as far as a blogging app goes _  if it doesn't save your posts and loses your hard work _  then it's crap. Don't bother.,1,04/09/2015,56
App822,org.wordpress.android,I use this app to blog while traveling. I have had simple posts (just text and photos) upload as blank SO many times _  which I finally realized is when I have too many photos (now I try to cap at 10 or 15). No indication that something is wrong _  just waiting 30+ minutes for an upload _  then finding out that it is blank. No usable draft _  no way to get the content back other than to start over. So incredibly frustrating. Also _  formatting is off when I try to edit on a desktop when I've saved a draft from app.,3,04/05/2015,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,Great app. I can put in posts _  save them as drafts _  and edit them later. I do this during down times at work or when I'm away from my laptop. Great convenience. I'd love an offline mode though (unless I just haven't found it yet),4,03/24/2015,6
App822,org.wordpress.android,Taking away the ability of CSS from the free users was a super bad move that will soon make the site fall _  as users will now move on to newer sites with better options. A better idea would of been making the use of CSS limited _  that way you give a taste of customization to your patrons _  and they'll be more likely to purchase. üòåüòí,1,04/10/2015,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,I need it to be more similar to the pc version _  like coloring and all other features that a person would use. Other than this when i edit something it look like html with all codes and it bothers me alot. Beside those problems i love it.,3,03/25/2015,2

App822,org.wordpress.android,Worked fine until the new app and new wordpress update.  My completely updated website _   the most important one _  won't connect at all. The only option is to install a 2 year old app that has a 2.5 rating to get the xml-rpc page to work. I have 2 websites on the same host that are hopelessly out of date that both connect to the app _  so the host doesn't block anything (I have 2 other services that have phone apps and work fine as well). The problem is either in the app or the site upgrade.,1,02/28/2015,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,It is good for getting stats and keeping up to date with comments _  and the writing platform is ok _  I like how it does the markup. You can't create children or nest pages _  which is very annoying.,3,02/21/2015,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,Since the update _  I have had numerous issues. Unable to publish _  loosing my vital write ups and so on. My posts have been removed and overall my website and its work _  the majority of it has vanished all down to one simple tap of the publish button of what was to be a new post. Which did not publish other than wipe my hard work. So thanks for that guys! Much appreciated! I will never rely on this application again!,1,03/17/2015,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,I love using WordPress online. However _  in the app needs much improvement. It's nearly impossible to post pictures to your profile or on the customization page _  and even if the upload works _  you still can't crop. It's a pain in the butt having to wait until I come home to edit my posts instead of just using the simpler app. The information text is often skewed off of the page making it illegible. another issue is the sidebar - it doesn't always show all of the features of the app. Poor quality app.,2,02/10/2015,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,WordPress is an every day part of my life.,5,01/20/2015,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,So _  after getting a reply from the developer _  I gave the app another try.  Now it's locking up the whole phone.  Who cares about cuter icons when your whole system is frozen?! What a disappointment.  I love Wordpress _  but truly hate this app.,1,01/21/2015,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,I used the desktop version and it works fine.  I recently got a new phone (samsung s4) and decided to download the app.  Won't even let me log in _  says that it can't log me in.  The Web browser version works just fine.  Very disappointed WordPress.  I hope this problem is fixed soon.,1,01/07/2015,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,When I try to upload a photo to a post it breaks the post and doesn't display the photo _  only the HTML markup. Then I have to hit a browser and fix it _  which makes posting on the fly useless. If this was fixed _  I'd go to 4 stars. If i could define a photo resize for uploaded photos _  5 stars.,2,01/09/2015,3
App822,org.wordpress.android,After the most recent update the app is basically useless. I loved it before but now the menu drawer on the side doesn't come out so I'm stuck with the view of my posts. Can't view stats _  pages _  etc.,5,01/07/2015,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,I like the app but the stats don't update correctly. I know I've received more views and yet it doesn't update. I also tried to edit my post but it didn't go through until I logged onto my laptop. Otherwise _  Nice app.,3,01/14/2015,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I came across a weird problem. I am using a plugin to compress all the uploaded images to 70% _  and it works perfectly through web browsers.

App822,org.wordpress.android,This used to be an amazing app. I posted most of my posts through the app instead of on my computer. Since the update the app no longer works _  and is extremely frustrating,1,01/12/2015,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,The new update has some issues. 1. When I select a pic the pic does not post. When I share a pic to a new post _  it posts the pic multiple times. Sharing pics to Media _  does not work either.,3,01/15/2015,6

App822,org.wordpress.android,Everyone keeps talking about WordPress.  But what is worth the point of picking out a theme if the app doesn't reflect it. Its just ugly blue basic ui.  I'm not very impressed at the hype at all.,1,01/08/2015,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,It does posting easy when you're away from PC _  well loading times should be decreased and it has some issues uploading media files every single post i did has problems adding img files _  all the photos that are uploaded gets to the starting point of the post and the we have to manually adjust the html code and editor can have features that are available in full WordPress of course and make editor better _  new material approach is amazing _  slide out bar can be little bit more "less crowdy",5,01/12/2015,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,Hello _  next update i hope you can add featured image options _  So i can update my post everywhere without my laptop..,4,01/06/2015,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,Whatever you did in the update it screwed up a wonderful app. I can't even get it to open now!,1,01/05/2015,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Great app for quick updates or edits on your blog when you're away from a computer _  but there are a few issues _  at least on my samsung galaxy tab pro. Editing pages or posts doesn't give you access to all features _  and if you're reading other blogs _  the comments section always says "no comments yet" even when you know there are comments.,3,12/24/2014,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,As others have said _  the functionality on this is less than you'd get in the Wordpress web page. Nevertheless _  it has all the main features and I use it all the time for posting blog entries when I'm not at my computer. I find it quick and easy to use _  much quicker than trying to log into Wordpress via mobile browser. It may not be for you if you want detailed control over the look of the blog entries _  or if you use a lot of media. Overall _  flawed but easy to use and better than the alternatives.,4,01/04/2015,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I've been using this for a while on my Droid 4 so that I can blog during throw-away time. Just now I was polishing a post when my phone crashed and I thought I'd lost all my changes. But then when I pulled the app back up the post was labeled "Local Changes"! Cool! All my changes were there! Very happy.,5,12/13/2014,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,Would be just what I need if there was any way of accessing the dashboard. Revised for newer version: practically useless to me now _  gives no control over blog itself only very basic posting capabilities _  very sad as a couple of years ago this used to have full dashboard access so plugins and themes could be upgraded or installed/uninstalled etc.,1,11/27/2014,3
App822,org.wordpress.android,It will upload small posts with no pictures in them _  but as soon as I attempt to upload a longer post with photos it starts a never ending upload which never actually finishes. Then when you go back into the app to see what is going on it deletes the post you were trying to upload and you are left with only the title and the knowledge that you have entirely wasted your time and need to write the whole thing and locate all the media files again. Totally frustrating. It worked fine on iOS.,1,01/04/2015,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,It WAS an excellent app for the functionality it offered. Allowed me to update my hosted blog away from home. I loved the new dashboard feature. It was quite flawless _  now it's broken. Please fix üòêüòëüòïüò¨,1,11/26/2014,10
App822,org.wordpress.android,Almost always uploading a new post freezes. Sometimes it just means I have to restart and hope this time it works _  sometimes it means the entire post gets lost and I have to re-type from scratch (which is quite annoying _  to say the least _  on a phone). Better host your blog with a provider whose software actually works _  instead of destroying your data.,1,12/02/2014,5
App822,org.wordpress.android,Working well for using Reader to catch up on the blogs that I follow. Editing a post was frustrating as I couldn't undo what I accidentally deleted. For comments _  I couldn't move freely from the post to and from the comment that I was writing _  nor could I copy and paste quotes from the post or other comments. I was glad to discover that I must redesign my blog header to be compatible with smart phones.,4,11/26/2014,4
App822,org.wordpress.android,This app is great for reading blogs that I follow _  but I will do just about anything to avoid writing or editing posts in the app. It's faster to write in another app _  take pictures in a second _  and wait until I can get to a computer to put it all together.,2,11/26/2014,14
App822,org.wordpress.android,Is it deliberate to just have reading functions only? What happened to rich text formatting _  picture uploads _  feature image settings and easy post uploads? I doubt this app would be on the Apple iTunes store with this rubbish. Fix up please,2,11/28/2014,5
App822,org.wordpress.android,The app normally longer connects to my account since about a week ago. Initially it couldn't upload articles and then when I signed out to see if that helped _  I couldn't sign back in. I hope this is fixed soon.,1,01/06/2015,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,When I schedule my post through the app for a future date _  it still post live. In order to schedule a post I have to schedule it twice in order for it to work. Please help. I tried restating my phone and I'm having the same problem.  Thanks!,3,12/26/2014,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I was able to post immediately with simple text updates immediately.  Fine so far; one star.  I was able to edit a post immediately _  and add a photo.  That's good _  too; two stars.  My edits DO NOT SHOW. Not so good.  Minus one star.  Video cannot be added from my phone; minus another star.  The message that tells me that leads to a non-mobile-optimized website for a videohosting/upload site; minus another star.  I would have paid for an app that would allow this _  but not an ongoing fee of US$60 _  thanks.  Not going to ding you for trying to make a living; I don't blame you in the slightest.  Just try not to make your sales pitch so obnoxious.,2,11/30/2014,4
App822,org.wordpress.android,Hi i always cnt upload my pics onto my post page section. I cant upload pics aftr i typed some words and i always have to upload first before typing but somtimes even uploading first also fails.,2,12/28/2014,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,This has happened multiple times.  Finish a post _   hit publish _   it gets to a certain point then gets stuck.  If I reopen the post _   it's completely blank.  Sometimes it'll show up a day later. Sometimes I have to completely rewrite the post _   then attempt to publish it again.,2,12/08/2014,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,This app works great with my customized self hosted WordPress. Though it does lag in the editor range I think that's just a limit of mobile platforms.,5,12/17/2014,4
App822,org.wordpress.android,I can access my blog but can't upload any post due to the above mentioned error...sorry.. Its not as good as I thought..,2,01/06/2015,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Another update that fails to address the ptoblem of not being able to access my self-hosted site so pretty much useless.  Please sort this out as a matter of urgency!!,1,11/26/2014,6
App822,org.wordpress.android,WP works great on my computer and phone _  but sucks on my tablet. The menu system jumps around _  when I tap on one item another is selected. Sometimes two menus will pop out and then I cant get rid of one. The mobile menu lacks the same look and feel of the desktop version.,2,12/28/2014,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,The app keeps getting better but I can't have two blogs active at the same time. Why?! It's annoying so please fix it. =(,4,12/14/2014,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I love this app one tiny problem since the update now when I receive a like on one of my posts the notifications  keep showing the name of the first person who liked instead of the new one. So 4 and 3/4 stars :),4,12/15/2014,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,This app is worthless. It's slow _  and the UX and UI are horribly restricted. On top of that _  if you do anything without an internet connection it will save a local copy _  but if you AT ANY POINT _  access your work and press "save" before it's loaded the existing draft _  it will erase EVERYTHING. Considering how much time I've spent writing posts that just disappeared _  I'd say this is one of the worst apps I've EVER USED.,1,01/03/2015,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I don't see what's wrong with it no matter how much people give it bad rates. I like this app and it helps so much for a blogger like me. I love the fact that I can secure this app with a password so that I can blog anonymously.,4,12/22/2014,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Aside from minor changes like the ability to choose from existing tags _  WordPress is simply the best mobile blogging app. It's robust _  clean _  fast and provides nearly all the functionality one can get on the web. The post editor needs work _  but as a whole _  this app is miles ahead of its competitors.,4,12/02/2014,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,I love it. Even though it is bad at editing.  It is great at reading other's blog _  reading you blog's comments _   and at commenting. The only thing that need to be fixed is the editing thing. Please work on make it better üò≠üò≠,5,12/13/2014,1

App822,org.wordpress.android,Hate the app completely  _  being a blogger I can recommend this app only to those who want to view other blogs.Not good for editing n writing stuff _  shows lot of lag,1,12/02/2014,9
App822,org.wordpress.android,I hate writing with this app. The upload almost always fails. Use this only when you are desperate. Good for reading but uploading is just a pain.,2,12/04/2014,4

App822,org.wordpress.android,I use this app to make a quick post and draft a longer post _  especially one with images. Most helpful feature for me is I can take a pic and press Share via Wordpress _  and then save it as a draft. A suggestion: support for multi blog login. I manage two blogs and when I want to post to the other blogs I have to Sign Out and then Sign In again.,5,12/20/2014,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,You can always go to the mobile site for basic things but the notifications and the ability to share items to it are what make this an essential app for me.  If you have a WordPress blog and an android this is fantastic.,5,12/30/2014,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,This app is really good for writing posts on the go/ staying up to date with stats. To truly be a 5 star app _  I think an upload bar should be added to posts/photos and videos that you're uploading. It's also awkward to upload a post once it's become a local draft. Edit: an upload progress bar is really necessary for the uploading of posts.,3,11/09/2014,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,Official Wordpress app just doesn't justify the tag 'official'. Doesn't work at all _  it takes forever to upload a simple post with less than 100 words and one single image. On top of it _  my phone stops responding.

App822,org.wordpress.android,I just wrote an blog entry for more than 1 hour. Then the app crashed and everything was gone!! I wrote it again and in the middle of writing it crashed again.

App822,org.wordpress.android,I use a captcha plug-in to prevent log-in spamming or hack attempts at the contr panel.  This app does not detect that and simply says im entering the wrong log-in credentials. Fix this and i'll consider my review/rating.  Until then _  one star for me.,1,11/13/2014,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,Haven't been able to upload posts for a month or so.

App822,org.wordpress.android,I tried logging into my WP site _  once _  using this app while on my home wifi but it couldn't connect. Now my home network is not allowed to load the page at all _  from any browser from any device. The server doesn't respond to my IPs request to view the page. I can only load the site using other networks so I have to go to a friend's place or public wifi. I tried using the app to log on using my mobile data and now my mobile IP is blocked too. Very troublesome. I've contacted support.,1,11/06/2014,3
App822,org.wordpress.android,Takes a really long time _  like two days _  to upload a short post with two images. Drains my phone battery and slows everything down.

App822,org.wordpress.android,This app is good for blog 'maintenance' - ie approving and replying to comments _  checking stats _  and making minor edits to posts. However _  posts are in raw HTML _  which makes writing ones from scratch complicated _  especially if you want bullets _  indents _  captions _  etc. The issue with this app is that the functions are all there _  but they're sometimes hard to use...,4,10/10/2014,16
App822,org.wordpress.android,Great app _  once you figure out which hoops to jump through to get the app to upload images successfully to the Media Library. Essentially you turn off preview _  and thumbnail _  and when you want to post _  you post as draft first _  then publish. This little workaround should be on the help site in bold. Couldn't be happier now.,5,10/11/2014,3
App822,org.wordpress.android,I travel a lot and like to blog about my experiences. I normally use Google's "Blogger" [on-line _  not their app] _  but trying to use it on my Samsung tablet was a 'pain'. It would take forever to load _  'freeze' up _  or quit altogether. I looked at their app _  but it's very limited as to what it can do _  i.e. _  can only load one photo in the posting. So I changed over the WordPress and really like it. The app and the on-line service synch seamlessly. And composing and posting with my tablet is easy.  My only criticism [hence the 4 stars] is that their menus/toolbars are somewhat complicated & not easy to master initially. But if you practice and become familiar with their 'process' _  it get's easier over time.,4,10/09/2014,4
App822,org.wordpress.android,This is app would be 100x better if... You had an IT person who could write actual complex phone apps. This app is merely a version of the web version only watered down because of bad links that are not compatible with all phones. You should focus on what's trending in the news. iPhone 6 _  6+  _  Samsung Galaxy Note 4 _  Note Edge _  S5 _  S4 _  Nexus 9 _  iPad 2 Air _  Windows Phones. Think about the operating systems. The phone should not be more advanced then your app.,5,10/18/2014,3
App822,org.wordpress.android,The app doesn't seem to retrieve my posts over WiFi. I tried doing the same over cellular data and it worked for some reason. Disappointing.,2,10/19/2014,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,The app is a handy way for me to update posts and other information on my Wordpress sites.  I'm currently using it to work with about 6 different sites and it's ability to switch between them is very useful.  My two complaints are on the handling of images and other media in the editor and the handling of bullet points (ul _  li) also in the editor.  In the post display _  both appear fine _  but in the editor they appear as raw HTML.   While I'm comfortable with working with the raw HTML _  doing so in a mobile device is akward.  The process of switching entry screens to get to the key presses to enter an HTML tag is a pain.  Unfortunately for me _  on at least one site _  both issues are common.  Of the two _  the bullet issue is the higher priority.  If we could get a button for bulleted text like we already have for bold and italic _  that would help a lot!,4,10/08/2014,3
App822,org.wordpress.android,Not so 'wp admin' friendly inteface and no much added value compare to the web admin interface via browser. Takes age to quit the application.,2,10/09/2014,6

App822,org.wordpress.android,Mostly a handy way to keep up with your blogs and add new material. One request: why do the comments continue to list all the spam comments forever? Once I have marked them as spam _  I don't want to see them. Can I filter seeing just approved or pending?,4,10/07/2014,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Good app to write the body of text _  article heading _  tags _  category and excerpt. However _  I cannot puck a featured image _  change the slug _  add a meta description and other important features. Stop upgrading pointless design features and upgrade the interface for less pricey smart phones.,3,10/12/2014,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,I am having such a hard time navigating this app. There are about 50 different "settings" pages and they are all for different things _  but not what i need.

And if I actually do manage to find them _  they disappear next time I need them.,2,10/23/2014,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,I tried to schedule 3 posts today and they all get published immediately. What a way to mess my blogging schedule. I don't know why this is happening but I'm really really frustrated right now. At one point there was a time when the app deleted a post that I saved _  and it was very long article I painstakingly wrote using a 7 inch tablet. And you know what's sad? I don't have an option but to still continue using it. Sigh...,2,10/27/2014,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,We use WP to do our travel blogs and find the interface from tablet to smartphone to PC clean seamless. Had some difficulties over slow internet (satellite) connections but it is rock solid with high speed terrestrial services. Posted text while away and imbedded photos later over high BW links.  SOMETHING HAS CHANGED! I am now running WP3.6 on my new ASUS Transformer tablet running Android 4.4.2. Seems you have to upload photos to the media now or the app will freeze. Used to be able to upload directly from 'Gallery' . THis seems a clumsy way to do it. Not sure I'm getting the value from Premium....,3,10/12/2014,4

App822,org.wordpress.android,Comments marked as Spam or those that are pending _  aren't syncing correctly _  causing an error when trying to delete them _  which in turn leaves lots of pending comments on the app that can't be removed.,3,10/16/2014,12
App822,org.wordpress.android,Its been twice now that I write a long blog _   upload photos _   and am either ready to post but need an Internet connection _   or I am just not finished yet _   I will try to save _   and it looks like it has _   until I click the edit button to go back to it and suddenly its gone! This is incredibly frustrating as I am traveling and only have a tablet to type these on and it takes some time.  I won't be writing another post through the app unless this is somehow fixed.  :(,3,10/11/2014,2

App822,org.wordpress.android,**Update: uninstalled because it keeps locking me out despite putting in the right credentials.Pics upload just fine _  blogs post just fine _  kinda strange to navigate _  somethings are just kinda buried in a menu of a menu. As a whole its not too intuitive for a brand new user who has never done this before _  and it is somewhat limited. All in all its pretty well done and does the job. Why 4 stars? The dashboard is hidden in a menu instead of on the main menu on the left. Too important to hide!,2,04/14/2015,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I seriously hate how every time I try to make a post with photos it fails. Then the draft is saved to my phone instead of my account. It's really annoying because I prefer to have my blog have word and images. So I only recommend this app for text posts and reading.,3,09/17/2014,12
App822,org.wordpress.android,I dislike that you can't set the featured image within the app but have to go to the mobile version of the site to do so. Please add featured images to your app it would make my experience so much better,3,09/23/2014,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,As others have noted _  photo uploads from the app frequently fail.  I would also point out that you can't create a Gallery from the app.  I find myself just uploading media from my tablet to the Media Library using the app _  re-uploading as many times as necessary _  then creating the post and gallery from Chrome.,2,09/23/2014,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,So when I first downloaded it the app worked well.  Then the last two times I posted it displays half of the photos large and the other half at the right size. This messes up the formatting and makes the post hard to follow.,3,09/17/2014,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,I'm off travelling for three months and decided to write a blog for friends and family  to enjoy while I was away so they can see what I'm doing. I've only been able to successfully publish one page as everything else I write gets wiped! I wrote one post 6 times and each and every time there was a problem publishing and I lost all my work. I've given up now as I've lost heart _  this blog was supposed to be fun but it's been nothing but stress. Now all my friends and family are disappointed that they can't see what I am up to. I'd recommend everyone to not touch this with a ten foot pole. I'm going to be deleting all my blogs and abandoning wordpress _  the head ache just isn't worth it.,1,10/04/2014,0

It may have taken awhile but they've regained my 5 star rating.,5,08/13/2014,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,I usually have a lot of pictures in a single post for my travel blog. The app does not allow more than one picture to be added at a time - to the post or the media library. It's very time-consuming to have to navigate to each image individually in order to include it in the post/library. Allowing multiple images - at least to the media library - would be very welcome.,3,08/06/2014,8
App822,org.wordpress.android,I have tried logging in to self hosted sites. Can't log in I keep getting incorrect passwords/user names. If I got this error for just one site I would assume it's user error. But I get this for every single site.   I couldn't find a solution on the forum. I think I will delete the app for now.,1,08/10/2014,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I use this app for a self-hosted site and it's a lifesaver. I'm usually not in a place where I can access my control panel by PC _  so when I get an idea for a blog post _  I'm able to start it here on the app. Is it a complete replacement for the PC site? No. But it does exactly what I need it to do while I'm not at my desk.,5,08/07/2014,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Deletes locally saved posts _  posts empty posts _  takes forever to upload a few lines of text and a dozen photos. I will not be using WordPress ever again because of this garbage app. Worked for a while and then endless problems. Should be able to access forum from app. Use an alternative site like blogger or something. I have lost a lot of hard work and my patience is at an end. I would give it 0 if I could.,1,08/08/2014,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,This app is so useless. I love Wordpress my girlfriend & me have a blog where we post our Interrail Adventures _  but this App is awful! Every time I tried to upload pictures it worked for some _  then suddenly _  after hours of working on it - everything just disappeared!!!! Or I clicked "publish"  _  I would wait for hours and it just wouldn't upload (with excellent wifi connection). It's frustrating as we've put so much effort into it and then some posts just disappeared. I definitely don't recommend this App!,1,08/14/2014,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,OK I can post..but it always says the post failed.  This causes me not to be able to edit in the app due to a copy not being available due to the error.  Also WordPress will no long post videos in a player from youtube.,2,08/12/2014,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,Over the couple of years I've used this app I return to it hoping it's better and although the functionality and layout is ok I consistently lose my work. I have had particular problems with photos. After half an hour of adding photos and editing captions I switch windows and come back and all my work gone. Sometimes just the text remains _  sometimes nothing.  Unfortunately I can't find an alternative app out there.,2,07/27/2014,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,It was a great app and very handy and useful to me. I was no one really using computer to post on my blog with this but with the last update I just can't upload images. Not in mobile not in WiFi. Already cleaned data and Uninstalled to install again and doesn't work. It will be just taking space in phone until an update fix this. Please fix soon. This app is very important to me.,2,06/19/2014,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Very well built _  clean UI _  super simple to use and it 'just works' so it has all the necessities.  The only thing I'd really love to see in the short term is for multi site support.  I manage multiple WordPress sites and every time I have to logout and back in.  I wish it saved the login profiles so I didn't have to constantly key in all the details _  or better yet _  just allowed me to change profiles (ala how its done for gmail or drive).  That feature would save me a lot of time.,4,06/12/2014,8
App822,org.wordpress.android,This is a great app and it's speed is remarkable. However _  since I have enabled two-step authentication _  logging in the first time from my phone (even after using an application specific password) turned out to be problematic. Could there be a step by step instructions somewhere? Or is there a way to remotely authorize the app?,4,06/19/2014,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I freakingly love it at first.. But after a week I can no longer update my posts.. Why? I can't even view my own site. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling it just now.. But it is not working still. Please help me fix this :(,2,07/28/2014,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,I can't see the notifications from WordPress on my phone. It's happened for almost one week. I've already check the notification settings out and there's nothing wrong with it. Please help me fix this issue. I communicate a lot through wordpress and this problem bothers me.,3,06/20/2014,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I published several websites based on WordPress _   and it is being really useful for my website. I just think that it could have more things. For example administration of users.  The biggest problem is that it doesn't manage more than one website.,4,07/01/2014,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I wrote a long blog and tried to publish it and it got deleted _  how Idk?  I refreshed _  I restarted my phone and logged out and back in again and poof _  I can't even find it in the trashed section.  SOOOO DISAPOINTED,1,06/23/2014,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,I wouldn't write content on this (mainly because I'd much rather type on a keyboard) _  but for keeping up with comments it's ideal. Be useful if comments manually marked as spam didn't show up in the comments list though...,4,06/22/2014,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I love WordPress _  but this app is garbage. I've lost several blogs already that I attempted to post. Just now I rewrote a blog twice and both times it just vanished when I uploaded it! I get nothing but the title and an empty body. I am fed up with it. There are no backups _  zero record of the blog ever being there _  and when I log in on my laptop the draft pages look completely different. Seriously _  what is going on with this? This app is useless- don't download it unless you like being angry,1,06/24/2014,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,Thanks. I like this apps. Been using for months. But couldn't explore much as I've been bz. But the apps is easy to use for me to add new entry. So I could update new entry anywhere which help me a lot _  in using time efficiently and help to control my emotional stress as I could write anything in my blog anywhere anytime.,5,07/10/2014,4
App822,org.wordpress.android,This app is good and solves a lot of problems with editing on tablets using browser. I feel this app needs good modifications _  like there is no menu button which is used a lot by website makers. Please Please Please update it. A big advantage is this app is fast !,2,06/11/2014,5
App822,org.wordpress.android,Seems like there are many directories to go through until it gets to desired action. Interface is bland - make categories (& section titles easier to identify?) more popup text entry boxes would be great instead of scrolling so much.,3,06/12/2014,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Just this week _  my posts stopped refreshing. I removed my self-hosted site and added it back _  but I'm still having the same issue. Been over a week and all I've gotten is one email asking what site I was trying to connect to. No support. No answers. Blocked access from my IP from too many failed login attempts. Needless (and sorry) to say _  the app is been uninstalled.,1,08/08/2014,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,For those with a self hosted blog _  after searching through WordPress _  I found that something was not enabled in my blog (I think it was the ability to post via email) and once that was fixed it was fine. I still prefer to use a desktop _  but looking at stats and dealing with comments is fine.,5,07/17/2014,5

App822,org.wordpress.android,If you enjoy squinting at your screen while writing in order to distinguish you article's text from HTML code _  then you'll love this app. I must ask: If Evernote & every other goofy little writing app can display bullets _  bold _  italic _  & other formatting as I am writing _  why can't this tool for professional writers do the same? I enjoy the WordPress writing experience on my PC/browser because I can engage the content & the formatting directly _  organically _  while I'm creating. The only time I must face HTML is for the occasional media embed _  etc. But with this app the HTML codes are scattered throughout the article & act like irritating little jolts from speed bumps as the appear in the paragraph I'm working on. So it's impossible to get into a state of "flow! " C'mon _  developers _  you can do better than this. I would gladly pay for a WYSIWYG WordPress writing tool. Until then _  it's back to my PC for writing & editing my blog posts.,1,07/13/2014,1

App822,org.wordpress.android,I just wrote a whole article _  the button for inserting images did not respond.

I went back to the app and everything was gone,1,06/23/2014,2

App822,org.wordpress.android,I initially gave this app 5 stars. But I have to settle for 3 stars after I used it. I'vehad some difficulties finding drafts of my posts. I had to check my blog on a browser before I can edit my drafts again and publish them so that partwas kind of unnerving.. If that can be fixed _  then it's back to 5 stars!,3,06/07/2014,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,I love it. But there is something that WordPress had never improve. I can't put the main photo on a post.

App822,org.wordpress.android,No search _  no 2F√Ä _  no WYSIWYG editor _  some markup tags are rendered in read mode... Needs much improvement to get 5 stars.,2,06/07/2014,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,I like the app.  It is easier for me to update or start a new posts from my phone.  What I don't like is the limitation to add images or videos in a specific part of the post _   unlike in the web version.,5,06/06/2014,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,They quickly responded to complaints and reinstated stats page. This shows they listen to customers which is good. Rest of app is reliable and easy to use.   ...... Previous Comment &gt;&gt; Last upgrade is terrible: The stats pane is a major downgrade. I've lost the most valuable feature which was the page views. No idea how you can do this without a warning so people can NOT upgrade :-(,4,05/12/2014,6
App822,org.wordpress.android,The main reason I use this app is to share my posts. Since I updated to this version of the app it no longer updates my posts . Once in awhile it says "pull down to refresh" or something obvious _  I can't tell for sure because it won't let me pull it down. If it keeps up this way I'm going to uninstall it and use my laptop to share posts. It doesn't always keep up with the reader either but it's not as bad as when I try to update my posts _  I like to see them on my phone.I liked it better before I updated it,2,05/22/2014,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,No matter what I do _  the post I just spent twenty minutes writing will only save as a local draft. It will not publish from the app to the website. And then the app crashes and I lost all my work. I don't know if the app isn't working or is just pointless _  but I will be uninstalling unless there is an update quickly.,1,05/29/2014,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Terrible app- always refers to local version if you've updated live version on another device. Won't let you do loads of things and navigation within boxes is really annoying. I can never seem to do what I want with word press on a mobile grrrr!,1,05/29/2014,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,Very new to this _  but seems easy enough... can't add photos to my blog from the app tho _  I have to do it in a web browser! The app doesn't open the upload box. I'm on a Samsung galaxy note 2014 edition.,4,05/18/2014,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I just started using this app and it does not appear to be updating... I go to the "My Posts" tab and it is not up to date... I guess it's good if you want to ust use it to post content but not to keep up with what you've been working on.,3,05/20/2014,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,The app is great for on the go and for those such as me who don't have a computer at home. The only thing I have a problem with is that I can't seem to view my site because the options get in the way. Anything I can do about this?,4,10/03/2015,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,After a slow start there seems to be a lot of effort going into making improvements with this app. One wonderful improvement would be the ability to link to other posts on the same blog by clicking on a drop down list of articles.,5,05/09/2014,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,If you trash a comment on your standalone blog's admin panel before doing so in your app the comment will not go away in the app. Any attempts to edit _  mark as spam or trashing the comment yields an error. The only work around is to log out of the app then log back in to each and every one of your stand alone blogs. Quite a chore if you have several of them.,3,05/22/2014,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,I love this app. I really do. But for some reason it's not uploading my posts. I've been sitting here for fifteen minutes waiting for it to finally decide to upload _  but no dice. I even uninstalled then reinstalled the app. It's still. Not. WORKING.,2,10/17/2015,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,This would be a 5 star review if I could do the following: insert multiple photos at the same time (or add multiple media files to a post _  as I believe you can in the iOS app) and manually set the location.  These two things are making it painful keeping my travel blog updated using my Nexus 7.,4,06/05/2014,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,The button that says"pull down to refresh" covers the title and status of the most recent post completely _  so that I cannot see the status or anything about my most recent post. Serious flaw.,3,05/28/2014,1

App822,org.wordpress.android,Working with the visual editor causes any formatting and images to show as code when you post.  Adds tags around images and such making it look horrible.  Particularly when trying to work on a computer at home and trying to finish on my phone. Ruined hours of work.   Lots of good things about the app but that pretty much ruins it for me. Not being able to even open a post mobile sucks.,3,05/19/2014,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,App looks good and convenient. However it's not allowing to copy paste data from other app. It says use ctrl+v to paste. How am I suppose to do that in android.,3,05/21/2014,3
App822,org.wordpress.android,Make the effing "tips" that came with the latest update go away... or have an option somewhere to make them go away. I'm well aware that pull down refreshes the page. I don't need to be told every on every page I view.,1,05/08/2014,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,The "tips" that show up can't be turned off and don't ever go away on whatever activity they appear on. When there is a tip _  it is impossible to click anything behind it. Very annoying. Next _  in landscape _  they have disabled the full-screen editor. I can't see anything I am typing. Not all of us use tablets and all of you app devs REALLY need to STOP disabling the full screen editor. That alone makes this 2/5. Also doesn't save html like setting paragraph text-align to justify. Practically useless.,1,06/24/2014,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Fine for writing on the go without having to carry a laptop _  even without internet. Stats section doesn't always work. Very good for keeping your webpage up to date.,4,06/04/2014,1

" post upload failed : An error occured while uploading the post "  Even if the post contain just a heading and 3 lines of content ( no media files ) the result is same.  For gods sake  _  plz fix this bug ASAP.,1,07/20/2015,2

App822,org.wordpress.android,1 star (down): Reader does not show posts from all blogs I follow. Stats are off. I am annoyed. The alternate option _  mobile web _  is terrible as well.

App822,org.wordpress.android,This is a great app; I am facing one problem _  however. I have multiple blogs which I manage through this mobile app and the notifications option in this app is somehow stuck at only one blog. It doesnt fetch notifications of other blogs which is quite unnerving _  if you ask me. Also _  the posts-refresh button doesnt work sometimes. Please look into it.,4,05/03/2014,3
App822,org.wordpress.android,I HAD TO MAKE INVITED VIEWERS "Authors" in order for them to view with the app! Whats the deal??? Is this some ploy to get me to pay the 99$ just to keep my blog secure or is this HUGE BUG just a very bad flaw??? I hope it can be corrected very soon if not then what is the point in blogging privately if my readera can mess with my blog?!,1,05/02/2014,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,I upgraded the app earlier this morning and now I am unable to save any posts with or without pictures.  Please fix this!   4:54pm Update: The error message says "an error occurred when loading media: no peer certificate" I took the pictures out and it still doesn't save to draft or publish. It says local changes.  I lost an entire blog post today of over 500 words because of this upgrade. I have never had an issue with this app since I originally downloaded it. Please correct this!,2,05/03/2014,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Stats page updates page views _  but my viewed posts and anything else tied to 'today' and 'yesterday' doesn't update. It's all stuck on a month ago. Logging out and back in doesn't help.,1,05/03/2014,10
App822,org.wordpress.android,It's not bad but comments should be from the latest to the oldest. Also in settings page allow to attribute a virtual name to blogs.  Update: it crashed my blog. Uninstalling,2,05/07/2014,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,„Ääv2.1.3„Äã Good app. Making drafts is easy with this app. Looking at stats is also nice. Posts is manually refreshed though. „Ääv2.7.2„Äã I like that it now pushes notification when a comment is posted. „Ää2.8„Äã Nice to have multi window support.,5,05/02/2014,6

App822,org.wordpress.android,Great way to access and add or alter your WordPress (self-hosted) site. Pretty straight forward in UI as well.

App822,org.wordpress.android,It's a nice app _  however _  I would really appreciate it if the developers could make it easier to upload photos in a blog post. I'm not able to upload photos from phone's gallery into my blog. It's also next to impossible to design from my phone. I'll give 5 stars if fixed. I only blog from my phone so I need these features to work. Thanks.,3,04/29/2014,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Worked well out of the box.  However I installed some security plugins that change the login page from the default for a hosted site (after my site got hacked through WP) and this app breaks.  Until I can tell it where to login (please let me do that instead of assuming its wp-admin) this app has become useless :(,3,04/18/2014,3

App822,org.wordpress.android,There are a few annoying bugs... like the tip to scroll down to refresh that (1) never goes away and (2) doesn't work. One example is updating your view of your own posts.,2,04/27/2014,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,Increased rating. This app has improved significantly the past year. Would like to see a list of previously used tags like you have for categories.

App822,org.wordpress.android,A few days ago my 'View Site' button stopped working. I now get a 'Webpage not Available' notification (both on my HTC OneX+ & on my LG GPad). If I try to open the page (by clicking on the globe icon _  above the preview) _  I get a security warning. There's nothing actually wrong with my webpage _  which continues to work. Any ideas re: fixing that? Such a great app _  otherwise -would definitely recommend for blogging on the go...  Ps. Some more options (ie. aligning text) would be appreciated.,4,04/10/2014,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,Just looking at the difference between mine and my wife's _  there is no option for the reader on mine but there is on the wife's. Both using Android _  both up to date.

App822,org.wordpress.android,I don't really use it that often but it works pretty well. It's good for quick postings and photo uploads. If you are trying to use it as your first choice _  prob not a good idea cause your might want to adjust the settings or plug ins might be a little wonky and that's not wp's fault _  it's the proprietary companies that slice up the original wordpress cms.,5,04/10/2014,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I would like to follow a specific blog with this app. Only way to search I can figure out is to give tags and hope it hits the blog you are looking for. So far no luck. Not impressed.,2,04/12/2014,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,I can't access my blog via the app! Every time I select "Visit Site" I get an error message. I am able to access my blog online anywhere _  including the same phone that has this appn with no problems. All of the other features on this app work except the "Visit Site" feature.  I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app but that hasn't helped. Please fix this. The app is useless if I can't see my blog on it.,1,04/11/2014,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,WordPress delivers _  whether on the desktop _  the 4G Android or the tablet/eBook reader. While I've used the desktop version for almost a year _  I only recently began venturing onto the mobile scene _  and was *shocked* to learn just how similar and feature-rich the Android port is. You can do almost anything on the mobile platform that you can on the desktop/laptop version _  including reading _  writing and learning. Thank you very much for your long-time support and aid in bringing mine and countless others' blogs to life _  wherever we are _  WordPress!,5,04/11/2014,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,Not intuitive enough _  I made couple of "mistakes" that got me headaches. First one _  I started a post _  and I wanted to save it _  so I pressed the arrow in the up corner to acces next options _  but that icon is a "paper airplane" that publish the post without even ask! Alright _  first use... I search for something like post adjustments (oh _  they were in the footer!) _  and changed the post to local draft. But it NEVER went to draft again in the blog!. Worst than that _  I continued editing it _  and the next time I accessed it _  a message appeared _  something like "the post is not updated _  do you want to?" and I thought of course _  upload the changes _  but what it did was download the first draft (the published one) overwriting the last one so I completely lost ALL of my work. "Well _  let's see the revisions..." but there's NOTHING like that. On top of all that _  I searched the internet for help _  and the only possible solution needed my device rooted before all this _  and search some hidden directories _  but it comes to happen that there are lots of people who doesn't even know what is to root an android device. ABSOLUTELY AWFUL!!!,1,04/14/2014,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,This app makes it possible to update any number of WordPress blogs right from your phone. It has a minimized interface so you can't do everything you can do on the web _  but its pretty good for every day posting and reviewing your content.,5,04/03/2014,3
App822,org.wordpress.android,Update: issues corrected: ) I pour myself into creating a post _  sometimes spending as much as an hour writing & editing _  which means something to me.  In one click _  (submit) its gone! I get an error saying my post failed to "upload" almost every single time now.

App822,org.wordpress.android,I can't upload media! No matter what I try _  it just won't upload.

App822,org.wordpress.android,I was on a trip very far abroad for only 16 days and wanted a way to quickly upload photos for friends and family to see so I didn't have to resend the same photos 12x's. Well I'm embarrassed to have bothered providing them all with the link with only 2 days to account for. Here I am on the last day of the trip and was only able to upload 2 posts due to a "media data" issue. I looked up just about every relatable issue and tried troubleshooting for 14 days. No luck. What a waste of time.,1,04/04/2014,2

App822,org.wordpress.android,Great,5,04/02/2014,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Wonderful even though initially I rated this app as crap because it simply gave me too many probe logging in via my android smartphone. The TEAM at Wordpress though persevered in helping me _  especially Dan (if you need the name of the guy who worked it out). So great app _  but I guess you still need to be guided through it. WONDERFUL once it gets working.,3,03/03/2014,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,Mostly this app looks and works great _  and makes accessing my WordPress blog on the go easy and smooth. There's just one strange and glaring oversight... When you go to view posts _  there's no way to view only drafts _  etc. this can make finding old draft posts that haven't been published yet... Difficult would be a kind way to say it.,4,03/01/2014,5
App822,org.wordpress.android,Be warned _  if you have 2-step authentication enabled _  you are going to have a hard time.  The app now continuously asks for an application-specific password despite generating one over and over again and being allowed to log in. When i log out _  it asks yet again.  Useless.,1,03/27/2014,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I am not a frequent blogger. I take my time and ask friends to review through feed back requests. As far as I can tell that is not possible through the app. But the problem is there doesn't seem to be a guide for the icons on the app. So I accidentally published something before I was ready just trying to see what the options were with the app. So far _  that makes my experience of it _  not very good. If you just want to write and publish and check comments _  it might be good for you. So far _  for my purposes _  I prefer using the website.,2,03/19/2014,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,Trying to create a blog and you can't customize anything! Only allows you to post. Using it off my samsung s4 yet it keeps saying computer. Don't install. Rather use your computer.,1,03/27/2014,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,Notifications are very scattered _  some comments load as comments I've had from days ago while others won't load at all. I could write better code for an app like this.,2,03/03/2014,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I agree w/ the no star rating on the update! I have made 3 posts via the app with no problem... I have been trying to publish a post for a week! I am in a country where I can't access a computer which is why I PAY for wordpress; great app reviews. I have spent hours everyday fighting with photo uploads... I have tried everything and have been sucked into a vortex of suckieness! Everytime I get close the app shuts down and I loose everything! Please fix asap!,1,03/18/2014,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,The feature set of this app is spread out all over the place _  implementing some basic features and some advanced features. I'd rather have all the basic features and no advanced features! I mean _  how hard is it to implement lists in the visual editor?,2,03/02/2014,6
App822,org.wordpress.android,I always get "unable to retrieve this comment" after getting a notification about a pending comment. I can't approve them. Moderating comments is exactly what you want to be able to do on your smartphone _  but this app has been "unable" to do that for at least a year i think. I love everything wordpress and automattic _  so a bit surprised and hoping for change. Galaxy S3.,3,03/04/2014,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I want to like this app. It would be great if it worked. Too bad it doesn't. I'm sick of wasting time trying to write posts _  then it doesn't actually publish the post. And it deletes my work when I try to back out and figure out where I went wrong. This app sucks. The "post" button should publish the post. Period. But it doesn't! What the Hell good is that? I can't believe this amateur crap is associated with WordPress _  the biggest blog platform. What a joke.,1,03/22/2014,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I just tried using the app for the first time yesterday. I updated a post _  working on it for over half an hour. Only to find out today that my edits were never posted to the actual site. When revisiting the app today what went wrong _  it refreshed itself _  causing me to lose all the changes I'd wanted to do. Annoying to say the least.   Not to mention that when I was editing the post through the app _  there was bits of coding all over. Good thing I am familiar with HTML so it was less daunting.,1,03/18/2014,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,I would love to give this app no stars _  instead of one. I have lost every single blog post that I have ever attempted to post through this app. There are so many errors _  such as the menu options disappearing _  especially if the blog post is over a few sentences long _  thus forcing me to delete the content. It also won't allow me to copy the text so that I can save it.  This is a terrible _  terrible app and I will never use it again. Uninstall.,1,03/14/2014,4
App822,org.wordpress.android,I love using my word press account but it is one of the most difficult apps! It has errors regularly and deletes posts before they are even posted to the main site. It is discouraging me from wanting to use the android app and just blog from my laptop to avoid all the hassle. Even their help services are not much help in fixing the situation. It is definitely better to know what you're doing ahead of time or you'll feel the walls trying to keep you from this creative outlet.,2,03/18/2014,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,I have WP for my BlackBerry too and this Android one is also good but I have problem with the drafts. Or maybe it is just me getting used to a new UI. After I turned off my tab _  the draft disappeared. That's all I'm complaining for. Other than that _  the app is quite good. I enjoy using it especially if I am away feom my laptop.,3,04/01/2014,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,The install got stuck at 100% download and didn't complete it. I thought this would be helpful. But after the reviews I have seen I clearly doubt it,1,03/10/2014,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Up until the latest version _  This was a functional but feature-limited WordPress app _  good for a quick draft or to authorise a comment.   However _  the latest version now presents a "There is no network available" message and does not appear to recognise a Wifi or mobile data connection (Nexus 5 _  factory 4.4.2).   Has been rated accordingly.,3,02/28/2014,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,It's functional for a few very basics. It won't show any of my posts _  it can never "retrieve" my notifications & it logs me out constantly. I actually always use the browser in hopes for an update to this fairly frustrating app.,2,03/11/2014,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,I use this app on my android tablet _  running an older android build. Why is the tablet app better than this one? My biggest problem is that this app doesn't push comment notifications to my phone _  which is one of the main reasons I got it! Galaxy S4,3,04/02/2014,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,All I want to do is have one place to be able to read blogs from THREE people. That's all. One doesn't appear unless I search for the specific url every time and another won't appear at all- it's a private blog but was always available on my iOS the wordpress app. The last is fine but that's hardly a good success rate. I don't need all the advanced features _  just a simple blog reader.,1,03/22/2014,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I have a self hosted blog. Pics won't upload except as a link.  Frustrating when I am posting from a hospital,1,04/01/2014,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,I like that it's basic and easy to navigate. The side column contains all the buttons i need. Anyway _  i never use the app for designing my blog _  so it works out.,5,03/18/2014,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Great app for the most part... simple and easy to use.  Have had very few problems _  except be prepared to hunt when it comes to troubleshooting.  Finding help when you need it is a bit of a challenge.  And customizing the layout with photos from my tablet is impossible.  A serious bummer _  really _   because Im travel blogging from the road and must use this app exclusively for set up and maintainance.  The "Drag and Drop" requirement to load local photos is impossible from a tablet :(,4,04/01/2014,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,Bit of a bug with logging in _  not very secure. I have 3wp accounts and no matter which login details I input wp takes me to whichever one it wants to. Eg. I input login details for wp1 it might take me to wp2 or 3. This happened on first use and also after i log out. Not good when they all have different passwords and usernames! Also can't seem to add photos from dropbox.,3,03/22/2014,4
App822,org.wordpress.android,The img src is not capturing the correct text when adding images. When manually editing the img url _  it will even be a mess. Should be cool but if unfixed _  useless after all.,2,03/31/2014,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I have to uninstall and reinstall every couple of weeks as the application doesn't process anything I like or comment on _  or even approve. Otherwise it is great. Just annoying.,2,03/28/2014,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,When writing semi long posts _  it starts to get very slow on my Galaxy S4. Also it would be a great benefit to have a black background so writing didn't kill my battery so fast. Otherwise very useful to be able to write offline _  thanks!,3,03/02/2014,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,I'm a great lover of the app for you and yours. I have a blog and I now have the application. I am positive that the app is going to be a huge boon to my ability to be more reliable than my computer system all the info I have a feeling that you are going to be able to get together with your products for free and keep them up to date. I personally love this application _  thank you.,5,03/26/2014,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,The UI update was a long time coming...  Still no option to hide the stats section that is useless to self hosted sites.  Dashboard is just the web version?  Wth?  Media section displays blurry thumbs.  Doesn't seem to have been tested out before releasing.  Editing pages/posts is a terrible experience. Offers nothing for the seasoned users.,1,02/26/2014,2

In my top post and pages if we click it we can't edit it but just open it via site.  I just wanna edit pleaseeee,3,02/25/2014,1

App822,org.wordpress.android,The app is ok but not brilliant. I can use it to moderate comments but don't bother doing much else via the app. Having a Samsung Note2 _  it's easier to use Chrome to do what I need.,4,02/20/2014,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,The most ridiculous and non-functional app I've ever seen. There are so many bags I cannot even name! I cannot upload any photo _  the scale of new post creation page is over sized that I can't see all the options. The navigation is enormously vague. I don't see comments I've made and blogs I follow. Finally the app crashes all the time. Well... The raw job. It's irritating.,1,02/27/2014,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,Version 2.6.1 seems to have fixed the upload error issue. Thanks for the quick response!  I'm still unimpressed with the changes to the interface but I can live with that.  Original review: SGS III with Android 4.3. Uploading a post from my phone since the update results in an error notification 80% of the time. And yes I am logged in to my Wordpress account _   Also _  the new interface requires more steps just to send a simple post as the post settings have been moved to a separate page for no apparent reason.,3,02/20/2014,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,I use this on my Galaxy Note Tablet and Galaxy S2 phone. It gets the basics done in a jiffy and I like being able to easily shift between my numerous blogs.

I would suggest the ability to set a featured image though.,3,02/25/2014,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Worst frickin' blog program I HAVE EVER SEEN! I have traveled around the world and blogged about my travels with this &@#$* program and it does not perform as advertised _  especially on Android OS. Yesterday _  I lost 3 hours of work due to your NON-INTUITIVE save and draft view features. Coupled with the program not-responding 2-3 times _  I was very frustrated using this POS program. Quite frankly _  the developer should shoot himself. Ha. I wish . . . Thanks Wordpress for absolutely nothing.,1,02/22/2014,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Only recently started using this application after a suggestion from a friend.  Glad I took there advice.  Great way to start blogging or keep all your favourite sites in one place.,5,02/20/2014,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,This app is fantastic _  but I'd quite like to see more features. Theme and Plugin management _  user management even ... I know I can do that on the site but it would be nice. And a bbPress app would be fantastic too! I can't find one in the Play Store.,5,02/22/2014,1

App822,org.wordpress.android,Wrote a whole post: the app can't upload it _  it just sits there as a local draft. Can't access stats _  or update the blog in any way. Tried to ask the developers for assistance: no response. Terrible.,2,02/03/2014,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,Really _  really basic. Making authoring posts on mobile cumbersome. I'd like to see advanced features on it. Oh _  also _  whenever I click on Edit post _  it present me the post in HTML. What the effing fish? Why can't I edit in WYSIWYG?,1,02/08/2014,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I used to stay away from WP app in the past as it was crudely written and totally user-unfriendly. I've decided to try again after a few years _  and I was totally blown away by how sleek and efficient _  and most importantly _  how easy everything is now. Thumbs up to WP for the app revamp!,5,01/31/2014,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,In July 2013 I lowered my score to 2 stars _  now I am lowering it to 1. Every redesign removes utility. I do a lot of work from my phone _  and I don't always have connectivity to access the full site via my browser _  like I was told to do last time I complained about utility loss.   Also _  as of Feb 2014 _  the app fails to upload any new posts or changes. It is completely nonfunctional.,1,02/02/2014,3
App822,org.wordpress.android,My experience of using it for a year now is not good. In defense of this application the competition is so dreadfully bad it stands out as the least useless of the android blogging applications.  The mix of html and WYSIWYG is baffling. I've been unable to use it for a while now because a bug was introduced that means I receive a 'cannot serialize null' error message when uploading posts because the jpg file extension is in upper case. Workaround is to change filename extension to lowercase. Paf.,4,02/15/2014,3
App822,org.wordpress.android,I initially liked the app until I ran into error code 83 illegal operation. I was unable to publish drafts I'd written. Luckily I'd emailed them to myself and was able to publish once I accessed via my desktop. That is still occurring as of 1/31/14 so I'm not certain I'll use mobile any longer unless it's the android that's the issue. I'll try on the iPad and compare,2,01/31/2014,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,had many great features that worked _  like dashboard of your site.  What happened?  The dashboard was awesome. Now it's just another 'post to your blog' app,1,02/10/2014,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I'm going to start using E-Blogger. WordPress is completely impossible; I've spent hours trying to make it work on several different occasions. The site says that I still have %99.6 of upload space _  but won't upload whether I use the app or the website _  even if I make my photos much smaller. Sorry _  but blogging without pictures is completely useless for me. I would pay for a space if I had used it all _  because I understand that a good service can't be free _  but this isn't good service. I don't even have room to type all the problems I've had with this app. I would not recommend this app to anyone.,1,02/03/2014,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,This works well if you just need to do very basic updates and limited formatting. However it is missing basic formatting commands (or they are hidden so that I can't find them) to justify text. So I end up doing a two step process _  enter the text I want on my tablet then have to go to the PC to format it correctly.   Overall it does what it needs but little more.,4,02/01/2014,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,This would actually be quite a useful tool if there were a way to change the default setting to save as draft instead of publish. I've only used it a couple of weeks and have accidentally published posts several times in that time.  Embarrassing and shoddy engineering.,1,02/04/2014,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Wish you hadn't changed the way the post is written. Took me a while to get back to set post preferences. It was much better before - why change a good thing?,3,02/01/2014,3
App822,org.wordpress.android,Before the update when I pressed 'View Site' it would show me my blogs _  but since the update it won't refresh notifications _  won't let me view my blogs also reader will not work as well.  The only thing good about the new update is the appearance...,3,02/08/2014,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,After the update I can't see the blogs I follow. Fix and I give a 4  The developer asked if I signed out and back in.  I did several times but it's honestly easier to navigate the site through my browser.,1,02/17/2014,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Since the update _  it keeps shutting down and won't let me post.  My post are time sensitive so I'm very disappointed in this app _  now I have to rewrite everything.  Do Better!,1,02/06/2014,1

I wrote a long post _  now I keep getting an error saying I can't upload it because I have the wrong username or password... but I don't. Every time I re-login I get the same issue. People are bugging me to make new posts but I can't post them! Otherwise I love the app except for the way the cursor jumps around when I try to mess with the font.

App822,org.wordpress.android,The update made everything better. The reader is more similar to the website thus giving the app a much cleaner look. The addition of the follow button on posts is great.

App822,org.wordpress.android,Hello! Please fix this app. I've been getting the system message: Post Upload Failed: Sorry _  an error offered while uploading the Post. Illegal character (d83d)  Thank you!,3,02/05/2014,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,On a number of occasions I have tried to publish drafts from Android Wordpress and nothing happens. Then _  when you try to exit the draft and save _  it says "There is a local version of this draft. Are you sure you want to sync this?" (or words to that effect). I thought that 'local' meant 'on my tablet' - it didn't _  and I lost thousands of words of a draft post. I would recommend drafting posts in a word app and then (and only then) moving it into Wordpress. This app is too unstable and with poorly worded instructions to rely upon as a fully working and secure text generation app. I have left support requests with Wordpress (10 hours now and no reply).,2,02/04/2014,1

Ughhhh....frustrating! Also whatever I start and draft on here would not be on my PC and whatever I start and draft on my PC would not be on here. Such a waste and disappointment.,2,01/05/2014,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,Overall this app just makes me frustrated because it keeps logging me out and preventing me from logging in. I even changed my password and it still wouldn't log me in. It also won't let me view my stats _  pages _  or themes.  I really love WordPress but remain unimpressed and disappointed with this app..,2,12/12/2013,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,I've had to uninstall and re-install about three times. The app just closes whenever I try to open it. After re-installing _  it'll work for a while before the same thing happens again. Please fix this. It is a Great app though,2,05/13/2014,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,The previous update had ruined the stats page - but thank to the team for listening and making the changes so that it returned to showing the stats info that is important! Great app _  and thankfully developers that listen... Would still like to be able to view my summary stats via the app though!,4,11/19/2013,38
App822,org.wordpress.android,I was just able to posts blogs from my Note 2 on the 16th of January _   as of last night I am unable to post from my phone as I keep getting the error. Was working fine before my phone updated. Seriously frustrating.,2,01/29/2014,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Not pleased with the stats update. Please bring back Top Pages and whatever that's suppose to be at the top always says "No stats available."  Uodate: Thanks guys! Rating changed back to five!,5,11/19/2013,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,Thank you for giving the stats more functionality again. However _  they're still not as good as they were. 1 more star if you give us back what you took away _  2 more if you give us even more detailed stats than before - after all _  the stats tell us what we're doing right,3,11/23/2013,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Cannot link from blog reader to blogs I read. App appears to render blank page. Going back closes the app. Other functions appear to work fine. Without fix _  this app is useless to me.,1,12/07/2013,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I have installe this app and i could not even register _  i have tryed many diferent user names and p.w including the ones the app suggested  and still shows the message  ( this username and password already exists) . in my opinion is a cheap constructed app .,1,01/17/2014,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,When I open Wordpress after I first power up my Samsung Tab 2 _  the functionality is a lot like the website. But once I've opened a blog _  I can't go back to see my other blogs _  and I'm usually stuck in a blog that isnt the one I was originally trying to post in _  and hitting the back button closes the app instead of taking me back to a place where I can see all my blogs! So confusing! Bad user experience/user interface research!,2,11/27/2013,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,It's fairly easy to create a post _   and simple to include pictures from your phone.  But on my Nexus 4 it won't publish.   Just tried it again on my Nexus 7. Still doesn't work. Complains about write permissions _  though the web based interface works fine.,1,11/22/2013,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,It deletes the brackets on HTML tags. Like _  what the frak? That makes the app completely useless. It posts big walls of text that resembles HTML instead of images.  Samsung Galaxy S4,1,12/30/2013,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,Am I missing it? I get email notifications on my android htc one sv phone that people have liked my blogs or are following me. If I click on the "view profile" button in the email _  it takes me to their gavatar where I cant follow them back nor like any of their blogs. If I use the WordPress app on my phone _  I cant find the reader or figure how to access people who have liked a blog. Clicking in their thumbnail by my like button _  again takes me to their Gravatar. People are loosing interest in my blog..,3,12/02/2013,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,A pretty good app. It does what you need it to do. It has a couple of errors sometimes when uploading photos in my blog and when I view my website within app. The menu always appears and can't get rid of it when viewing. Very annoying. Overall good app though.,4,01/30/2014,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,It used to be that this app allowed more than one blog to be added to the app. Now? I try and try to add a second _  but the app zooms through the sign in process without allowing me to change the information (thereby adding the other blog). Instead _  it just keeps signing me into the blog I'm already signed in to use! Sigh. This used to be a great app. Now  it's all but useless.,1,12/28/2013,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,This is a nice app _  works really well. However _  I'd like to be able to filter my posts. Draft _  published _  pending. And perhaps a search feature. I have too many drafts _  so it's a pain in the butt to scroll!,4,01/14/2014,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,This update ruined the possibility of using several accounts _  which makes it very difficult to update several blogs. Therefore _  1 star _  and that's because I can't select zero.,1,11/19/2013,8
App822,org.wordpress.android,I have issues on my tablet with the widget every so often cuz it tells me the app isnt installed. Once i reinstall it works but have had to reinstall several times. If this is fixed it would be great,4,12/29/2013,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,editing posts is difficult to scroll paragraphs without scrolling page - this results in whole paragraphs inaccessible to edit. FRUSTRATING. Nice interface but please address this issue.,3,02/01/2014,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,It's working _  but the problem is when I view it on PC _  the paragraph format following mobile format and it's not beautiful..  Please fix it.. then I'll give 5 star again..,1,01/08/2014,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,Good! But being on the road often _  could you allow automatic posting of all local drafts whenever there is connection? Alternatively _  i wouldn't mind being able to multi-select post/pages for an action (trashing _ publishing _  etc) too =),4,11/25/2013,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,I had  with keeping drafts unpublished and synchronized. Stripped square and angle brackets on a lengthy post. Other frustrating problems. Would not recommend.,1,12/10/2013,1

App822,org.wordpress.android,but my notifications continue to be awol. Comes up blank and when I try to refresh _  it says "Sorry _  notifications cannot be refreshed at this time. Please try again later." How long is later _  because I have tried months later and still have the same problem. Pity _  because otherwise I find the app pretty great.,4,01/03/2014,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,You must get this app if you press. Access to comments _  posts _  back end of your blog _  as well as the WordPress community. It takes a few times to get used to it _  but it gets easier every time. Well worth the free download.,5,01/12/2014,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,Terrable. It is never able to load my posts or pages. I can access them on my computer but this app is terrible. Don't waste your time.,1,11/29/2013,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,It keeps freezing up _  and really difficult to navigate now. I liked the simplicity of the app previously _  now I have no idea where to find what I need. And cannot upload pictures as it freezes up.,2,01/14/2014,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,Just keep having the form fields refreshed on the sign up page. No validation _  doesn't work.,1,01/03/2014,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,Can't get past the sign up page. Tried to uninstall it and then reinstall _  but it just does the same thing _  which is nothing. Too bad. Looked like a good app.,1,11/20/2013,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I previously gave this app 1/5 as it wouldn't upload posts from my moto g. Since the android update that problem has been resolved. But now the app sometimes loses the last things I did _  so they don't get published with my posts. Things like the last paragraph _  the category I assigned or a photo I uploaded. So it gets frustrating still.,3,01/19/2014,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,Was a good app up until you destroyed the stats page. With the onslaught of complaints how could this have made it past review and testing? Especially when it was touted as the main feature of the latest update.  Please fix. It doesn't give correct stats _  the week and month remain at 0 _  and as others have mentioned the page views and countries are gone. Also on the day _  the secondary tabs are mostly incorrect as well.   *Update* - Version 2.5.1 fixes a lot of these issues.  Still a problem with view count.,4,11/18/2013,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,Something so basic is still not  supported in this app after all of this time? Epic epic fail.,1,01/09/2014,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,Cant see stats details until the next day and then it's a hassle to click "yesterday" for each detail.  I think you've plenty of room to improve stats functionality.,3,11/29/2013,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Clunky multisite handling _  but worse: Edit a pre-existing "draft" post _  back button _  hit save _  and for some stupid reason the new edits are saved locally to your Android device NOT to your blog. Painful lesson _  sloppy design.,2,01/26/2014,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,It takes more than a bit to get me this frustrated. I tried and tried to build my blog _  user name taken. Okay _  change the name _  it goes back to the original name I submitted. I have deleted and reinstalled twice with no success. This is on a Note 3 so I think it should handle this _  what is wrong with this app _  should I apply on my computer and then add the app?  Still no response from Developer after numerous emails _  is anyone else having issues where it logs you continuously and any posts end up in draft?,1,01/17/2014,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,theres not enough categories. I like to learn about religion but theres no option for that.  Also _  I cant see any search option. This app needs to be abit more simple for beginners.,3,01/17/2014,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Unfortunately the app for Samsung Tab is full of glitches. Better to access WP through your browser of choice.,2,12/29/2013,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Updated: glad that the stats page is updated!   Agree with others. The stats page has been stripped down to providing no useful insight to us. I want to view page hits/visits and also stats from the previous day.,4,11/19/2013,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I love WordPress they all have  helped me with all kinds of   (things on Blogs that I didn't know an the people on here are really so nice to talk too _  I really am very happy with this. Thank You !! <3<3.,5,01/01/2014,1

App822,org.wordpress.android,I switched over to a self-hosted WP blog _  and now the app barely functions for me. I was getting notifications for new comments _  though the notification pane said it was not available _  but now I've stopped getting notified when someone comments altogether. I deleted and re-added my blog _  and still no notifications.,2,01/14/2014,1

App822,org.wordpress.android,The update isn't that great. The app in it's previous form was quite close to being perfect however I seem to be having problems adjusting to this one.,4,12/27/2013,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I've uploaded a grand total of one post from this app . All the other 12 times I tried _  it always says error. Can't upload. Incorrect username or password which makes no sense since I obviously logged in to create the post. It saves error posts as a draft but those drafts don't end up on my actual dashboard when I open WordPress from a pcwhich means I have to rewrite EVERYTHING I wrote on my phone and upload photos from my phone to photobucket just to post something. This app is pointless.,2,12/27/2013,1

App822,org.wordpress.android,The new blog posting process is somehow interrupted and doesn't finish completely if I clear the 'uploading...' notification.  As a user I would assume that such a process should continue in the background.  Next _  if I open the app again _  it doesn't show any indication of the ongoing process which doesn't give me any kind of update (of whether the new blog got completely/half way uploaded/or cancelled).  To check this _  if I manually click the 'refresh' icon on top-right corner _  it gives a warning message which is really doesn't help the user what his/her action should be.,2,01/02/2014,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,Wordpress is a nasty _  glitchy _  buggy _  irritatingly difficult to use piece of crap - on my android phone *and* windows laptop. And the text editor just lives right down to those awful standards. I only use it because it's become ubiquitous for blogging content. But I hate it.  Using wordpress in my phone's browser crashes the phone repeatedly _  and using it in the app is impossible - the text selection tool is massively unstable _  the side menu drags out when I don't want it to _  the blog reader doesn't work.,1,11/19/2013,5

App822,org.wordpress.android,I loved everything about the stats page in the WordPress app - it was quick & easy and had all the info I needed in one place. Now it's been over-complicated _  yet it has lost vital figures such as a view scale _  countries & popular posts! Please just change this back - if we want comprehensive stats we'll get them from the desktop dashboard!,3,11/14/2013,3
App822,org.wordpress.android,My first impression has been very positive. I've been able to login _  create and update post in a blink of an eye. It's very easy to use and reacts quickly.  I only missed one thing: the possibility of selecting existing tags so I don't have to remember which tags I can choose.  I also don't understand why when you create a post you see it in rich format (links underlined _  bold letters) and when you edit one you see it in HTML.  Anyway _  the overall result is excellent.,4,11/16/2013,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,There seems to be a craze  among developers to do what they can to make apps worse!  As for this one _   I agree with others here. One page for stats was fine and now the most interesting features; countries and top posts are gone. Please bring them back!,2,11/12/2013,20
App822,org.wordpress.android,Ditto what everyone else is saying about the stats update. I can no longer tell which posts people are viewing and I can't tell what countries they're coming from. I don't want to have to view the full site on my phone _  because then I have to login and that seems to negate the purpose of an app. I really liked the stats page as it was before.,2,11/12/2013,7
App822,org.wordpress.android,Last update killed all the stats. I cannot see any of them _  just full of zeros and I have to use desktop wordpress to get info.  I reinstalled the app and cannot login to my account any more _  apparently my login and password are incorrect. Funny _  'cause I use the same ones I use on my computer and which work obviously. ANd I still got the notifications from Wordpress on my mobile,1,11/18/2013,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,Having never used WordPress or this app _  thought I would give it ago. Spent an hour writing the "about" section _  clicked update and nothing happened. Looked about _  no obvious save button. Tried to copy my text in case it went wrong and it copied something entirely different. Will looking for the save/update function and the page went off somewhere else. Got back and all my text was gone. Tried the auto save function _  got a blank page. Tried to paste my text and that failed. Utter crap GUI.,1,11/12/2013,3
App822,org.wordpress.android,Loved the stats page in the previous versions _  but now I'm not getting ANY stats _  current or past.  Oh _  I'm using the Android version.  I updated my site with the latest version to see if that would make a difference but haven't seen any change as of yet.  I need the stats without having to go log in through my PC _  which isn't always accessible.  Please fix!!  :)  It's a five-star if this can get fixed.,2,11/12/2013,10
App822,org.wordpress.android,Like so many others _  I find the stats frustrating. Yes _  it's faster _  but half of the information - such as country - just doesn't seem to be there any more.,3,11/12/2013,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,If it ain't broke _  don't fix it.  Well _  also- if it ain't broke _  don't break it either... which you did here.    To echo the popular opinion _  the updated stats page is a complete headache.  Without the daily/individual page/country views _  it's practically useless.  And this tab system is a mess _  please bring it back to one page like it was.,1,11/14/2013,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I actually like the new look for the stats - but why have all my stats been reset to zero? And they've stayed there for days _  even though I can see _  by looking at the stats via the browser _  that lots of people have visited?,2,11/15/2013,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,It WAS a great app _  till latest version. Now the most important thing to users has been designed OUT! You can't see views by post any more! Baffling. I'd love to hear their reasoning behind it.,2,11/12/2013,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,Every time I try to share a pic through our Wordpress blog _  I get an error message regarding inability to upload media file. Used to work on my Moto X.,2,11/12/2013,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,That the Smartphone version cannot compete in the "long and complicated posts" department goes without saying. But it is an excellent _  versatile tool for quick updates and corrections _  and in theory even capable of creating aforementioned meandering posts of literary value.,5,11/12/2013,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Can't see previous stats or specific page hits. Now I have to go to the full site to see my useful stats. The app is nearly useless to me now.,1,11/12/2013,3
App822,org.wordpress.android,Is there a help forum for this app? I can't find it. Couldn't figure out even HOW to publish for 5 minutes while I tried every button on the phone. Some help files _  help videos _  help anything would be appreciated.,1,11/11/2013,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,The latest updates have given me a dreamy experience for uploading photo galleries to WP. I can manage all my best photos on the mobile app (first by downloading my pics from my DSLR via eye-fi SD card) _  then upload to the WP Media Library _  all from my phone. The gallery options in the WP app mirror the desktop experience. I feel incredibly liberated not having to go through folders upon folders on my desktop computer to manage my pics. I can use a photo filter on the pics I want on the phone _  then post to WP. I'm gearing up for a whole new chapter of blogging goodness!  OLD REVIEW:  I love WordPress...on desktop. I've come to the conclusion that I can't even post a basic 500 word post with 4 pictures from my Nexus 4 (with Android 4.3). When I insert a photo in the post _  it says it's there and then when I publish _  it disappears. It short _  a very frustrating experience. I'll continue to draft posts on the WP mobile app _  but I'll have to include images from the computer (which defeats the point of mobile posting). I hope WP decides to make something more than "half an app." Many other issues make this a 2-star experience.,4,11/13/2013,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,This appears to be just in code blocks - a " is turned into &quote; and if you don't spot it in time _  turns it into &amp;quot; and so on... Makes the editor unusable.,2,11/17/2013,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,All of them _  gone. Constantly telling me 0 Views _  0 Clicks _  0 everything _  despite my site stats telling me otherwise. I hate having to login to blog to look at my site activity. This is REALLY bad QA guys _  the type of which would flunk you out of a Programming 101 class.,1,11/13/2013,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,As everyone has said: the stats pages are all messed up! Everything is stated as 0 when I know that it's not the case; I can see my stats from a regular web browser _  but not through the app. Fix this _  please!,2,11/14/2013,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,What the hell happened to everything in one page? Now I can't see country's nor post hits this new update gets no stars its gay want old one back.,1,11/12/2013,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,As long as I've had the app I've been unable to reply to comments using the app. This is a pain because I'm only able to get to the laptop in the evenings.,1,11/15/2013,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Like lots of other people my stats don't work after today's update. And don't tell me to use the full site link. I don't want to that's why I have the app.  Edit: uninstalling and reinstalling worked. Thanks :-),4,11/12/2013,3
App822,org.wordpress.android,One star because the stats pages don't show any content any more since the last update. Plus because stats pages have been divided among several pages.,1,11/13/2013,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,Solid app for WordPress. I manage many different WP sites _  so it'd be nice if you could add multiple self-hosted sites rather than having to sign in and out of each one.,4,11/11/2013,1

App822,org.wordpress.android,I have several sites that run WordPress and finally getting around to reviewing this WordPress app.   To sum it up _  it really isn't all that great. The dashboard within WordPress by default allows galleries and custom posts. All this app does is allows you to write a blog and add a photo or video. There is no setting featured image _  adding a gallery and unless you modify the dimensions of the photo you insert _  it will maintain the full size. Just log into WordPress via the Web and do your stuff there.,1,09/11/2013,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,I find the app very easy to use _  and it's practically the same as the website. I mean _  I am also able to upload photos and stuff _  which is really good since some mobile applications limit their features _  as opposed to the real thing. So far I haven't seen any glitches as well. It's great! (‚åí‚Äê‚åí) ~‚ô°,5,10/26/2013,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Wordpress please note. The latest version onmy Samsung Galaxy Note has issues:  Stats >> Visitors & views  * WEEKS shows DAYS data  * MONTHS shows DAYS data instead of month's data. * Also on all 3 - the graph doesn't appear. It just says "No stats available" even though the stats are available when refreshed.  * Refresh button doesn't work sometimes (looks like this issue is resolved in the latest update). Over all _  this app is good. Support for plugins would have been an ideal one.,4,11/13/2013,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,I like this app but I wish it gave the ability to manage user accounts. Perhaps it does and I just can't figure it out.  So for account and page management it would get 4 stars _  but with no user management it loses a star.,3,09/23/2013,1

App822,org.wordpress.android,I installed this app before but I wasnt even able to log in so I decided to delete it. I tried re-installing with hopes that I can finally log in but still to no avail. I even reset my password and logged on using browser but the app just won't let me log in. It just says "Connection Error",1,08/19/2013,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,Thanks for the new features! Now blogging will be better since I have lots of images in my Picasa/Google+ account!,5,08/19/2013,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,But _  every time I go to the 'view site' tab _  I get the password is incorrect error. Log in _  works fine _  but as soon as I leave that tab and come back to it it I get the same error message and have to log in again. It's a P.I.T.A. with a 24 character random string password. Is there a way to fix that?,4,08/08/2013,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,This would be a nice app _  except there is no way to view _  edit or create custom post types.  That's a deal breaker.  What good is an app if you can only access half of your content?,2,08/17/2013,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,Indefinitely says my password is incorrect. I sit at my desktop and use the same password and viola! It's fine. The only way this app works is through the 'full site' option which _  at that point _  why bother and just use Chrome? Disappointed.,1,08/09/2013,14
App822,org.wordpress.android,Still _  a poor baked substitute for the  webbased back-end wp dashboard. The minimal functionality is declining and buggy with every update. Good attempt _  but long way to go. Even then _  with all the wp plugins around _  this app will only give you the basic wp features _  ever.,2,08/13/2013,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,Seeing it come from a downright ugly all at the start and evolving to become this awesome beautiful app _  I do want to commend the developers. Great job with this app. Makes managing my blog on the go so much easier!,5,08/22/2013,8
App822,org.wordpress.android,This app used to be pretty great _  but it appears they have tried to "simplify" it and remove almost all of the functionality. I can't access any of my plug-ins. Where's my old dashboard? What the hell am I supposed to do with this app now anyway? Good thing I have a backup if the old version...,1,08/10/2013,3
App822,org.wordpress.android,Use this app daily all day and I haven't been able to view my blog stats or my clients blog stats. Says name not associated with account which is incorrect. Having to use my iPad Mini to check stats which is an inconvenience. My Note2 is my main device. Rating down from 5 Stars to 3.,3,08/09/2013,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,I was kind of disappointed _  the install video would not play and everything was very small on my android screen. Wish you would fix these problems with your app so that I can enjoy learning everything it has to offer. Looks very interesting.,2,08/09/2013,4
App822,org.wordpress.android,This is really crappy! It keeps giving me a password error _  whereas the same password works not only from my desktop but from my mobile's browser. What's the point of having this app when I need to use the browser?,1,08/13/2013,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,I used to love this app _  but after recent updates _  it no longer remembers the self-hosted sites I add. Using this app for 1 site _  and 1 site only _  makes no sense.,2,08/15/2013,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,Please _  put View Admin back to the slide out menu! There's no reason why we should be going all through the settings menu to do so! It's more of a hassle!,1,08/13/2013,14
App822,org.wordpress.android,Once I was able to get emails going back and forth with the customer service team _  I was able to get my Wordpress account up and working. I don't use the app as often as I would like to _  but I know that it is a quality app for when I need it.,5,08/13/2013,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,I know the View Admin option has been moved to Settings _  but I go to the Admin a lot to manage users _  group access _  and other features of installed plugins.   Any way we could get the menu item back _  or perhaps have an option to show/hide the menu item if others are bothered by it? I mean _  I even installed a plugin to make my admin mobile friendly.  Thanks for the consideration. Love the app otherwise.,4,07/24/2013,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,This app was great until the last update. The part of the app that I used the most was the admin page access. It was always the first thing I looked at whenever I opened up the app.     I maintain several WP sites for myself _  both business and personal. I use the app for when I don't want or have time to sit down at my pc to do updates.      Where I thought the app shined was maintaining my WP sites. The app allowed me to be able to easily cycle through all my sites quickly to see if they needed plugin or WP updates. After selecting the admin option _  I could click each site and within minutes have all the sites updated _  significantly quicker than using a pc to do it.    With the latest update to the app _  the developers buried the admin page access 3 clicks deep _  so what would take me 1 click + a click per site to check update status _  now requires me to click into the settings _  then 2 clicks per site to check for update status.    I considered this app a 5 star app before this bizarre change. I'm hoping it was an oversite or test on the developers part and that they'll fix this in the next update.  Otherwise _  at least in my opinion _  they've partially crippled the app.,2,07/13/2013,12
App822,org.wordpress.android,Every single time I add a picture it messes up the code so I have to manually go back in every single time and add literally only a bracket.  This has been a problem for years and even did this while I used an iphone.,1,07/16/2013,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,It's convenient to be able to write blogs on the go (when backpacking through Thailand _  for example)... but it's extremely frustrating having to fight with the WYSIWYG formatter every time you save (ie _  it adds too many br tags _  li tags _  etc every time you save your draft).  I am used to writing my posts in HTML ("text" editor) _  and it would be nice if this was an option in the Android app.,3,08/04/2013,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,This app does what you can do via web. The app is a bit slow while uploading comments. So 4 stars. But the ability to add multiple accounts gives it one more star :),5,07/22/2013,3
App822,org.wordpress.android,The only useful function in this app was the admin section.  It is now all bit useless.  Inconvenient and does not allow access to installed tools.  I have used this for a year and am uninstalling with 3 hours of this update.,1,07/20/2013,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Clunkier and even slower than it used to be _  I feel like the push button options were easier. Also _  switching between blogs under different administrative auspices is not only a chore _  I seem to not be able to do it anymore. I get "bells and whistles" as there's lots of competition _  but WordPress has a long way to go with their mobile app. On a desktop _  I love it. Phone: headache.,2,08/02/2013,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,What's up with that? Quick access to my dashboard was kinda my main usage of this app.. Almost entirely useless to me now. My posts run through too many plugins for my to do mobile posts with correct results. So... Yeah. Any chance of getting the dashboard back?,2,07/19/2013,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,Your new update sucks big time. There was no need to take out the ability to save a local draft. Bring back the Local Draft option. Also when I save as a draft and I have no internet connectivity _  I lose my work. Why??????,1,07/15/2013,26

App822,org.wordpress.android,This is an indispensable tool for WP blogger. The GUI is clean _  uncluttered and smooth.

App822,org.wordpress.android,Would be excellent _  but it's eternally logging me out! Every time I switch between two elements ('pages' and 'stats' _  say) _  it logs me out _  then repeatedly tells me the details I'm entering are incorrect _  when they're not. Very frustrating.,3,06/16/2013,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,Everytime I try to post anything it always says "Incorrect username/email and password. Sign in again" Even though it's correct. please fix it right away. it's so annoying that I can't post on my own blog. -.-,2,07/11/2013,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Trouble uploading pics. Complete pain in the behind recently. But Im waiting to see if that "reliability improvement" update will make this app better. If not then i might be forced to switch to an entirely different blog platform.,4,07/11/2013,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Some elements of the app don't scroll - eg calendar editor doesn't scroll whuch means you can't edit/create entries. Also _  top horizontal menu bar doesn' t sxroll across. Great app rendered unusable on Android as a result.,3,06/12/2013,4
App822,org.wordpress.android,I know I recently said there were no problems with the app _  but I've definitely discovered some big ones. First of all _  there's this ridiculous "auto-capitalize" feature that seems to always be on no matter where in a sentence you are. Also _  editing and writing posts is near impossible because scrolling down your post seems like a project in itself _  wish you could actually zoom out more. Even writing comments on posts seems like more work than it's worth. Other than that _  not bad.,3,06/23/2013,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Still can't set featured images for posts _  so the furthest you can realistically get from mobile is a draft. Featured images are such a core feature and so many themes use them _  I continue to be absolutely baffled by the lack of support. I'd love to be able to post direct from my mobile _  so I hope featured image support is added in the next update.,2,07/01/2013,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Eg when I click Post option _  it says Connection error. Same goes for Pages link. Notification _  Reader _  stats works fine though.,2,06/22/2013,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Don't waste you time. Program won't let you edit in WYSIWYG mode! I have been using WP for years and have come to loves it for it's robustness _  stability and simplicity. This app is a great disappointment as it a make editing _  managing _  and updating using mobile devices an act in futility. In spite of smaller screen using standard web browser to perform routine task is far superior to using this program.,1,07/10/2013,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I used this app daily for MULTIPLE BLOGS... now _  it is useless!  Allows only one account???  UI is oversized on Galaxy Tab (Original 7" version).  What happened guys?  Used to be a GREAT APP... BRING BACK the one a few versions ago _  please....,1,07/04/2013,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Unfortunately _  I can not rate WordPress too favorably. Within 10 minutes of using this App I have had 4 crashes.

App does not crash but after trying to edit a post it is near impossible to move cursor to desired location.,2,06/15/2013,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,The official and the best. Works FINE on my tablet. Have not used it much yet but hey _  I only got it today and nearly everything I use works. It isn't buggy at all (for me) and this app will be with me for a long time.,5,06/18/2013,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,This app is extremely buggy. It constantly fails to display blog postings that I click on from blogs I follow. I have to close the app _  re-open it find the post again _  and click again.  It's very annoying.   Also - when the app gives you notifications of replies to comments you've made _  it doesn't show you which comment of yours the person was replying to. It just says "In reply to your comment on..." and to see that comment _  you have to press an icon that launches a Web browser.  Annoying!,2,06/22/2013,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,It doesn't give me the options of composing a blog in Visual or Text - can only do it in Text. Also can't add new photos _  when I click on Select _  nothing happens.  Thank you for your reply to my rating and while that does allow me to add pictures _  it doesn't give me the ability to alter text colour _  make some text a URL etc in other words there is not a WYSIWYG editor - unless I am missing something obvious _  so my rating remains as it doesn't give me the ability to everything the website does.,2,06/12/2013,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,This app does everything it should _  and it does it with so very small footprint. There are other apps that are 10-15 times larger that this one that do not do an effective job and have far too many bugs. This app has very few _   or no bugs at all compared to the"fatware" that's out there.,5,05/10/2013,10
App822,org.wordpress.android,Over the year _  there have been vast improvements both in the visual style and the UI. Love the sidebar that slides with all the same choices as the windows interface. The main viewing screen is a bit scrunched and in view admin and stats pages _  they are cut off on the right hand side _  obliterating today's stats.  Sometimes force closes automatically midst-post.,3,06/01/2013,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I wish the app would give you an option to sync what's In the sever into your tablet or what's in the tablet to the server. I had a bunch of posts on my blog _  I had to move my blog to a new server; confident that I had all those posts on my tablet _  after the new server was setup _  I went to the tablet _  logged in with my blog account _  I was still able to see all my posts saved on the tablet _  I then hit Sync _  thinking that all my posts were going to be uploaded. Well they did not. To my surprise it erased them all leaving me with nothing more  than a hello world post. That was a catastrophic.,1,05/14/2013,3
App822,org.wordpress.android,It logs in and I can see everything normally. But if I click on ANYTHING _  it says wrong ID or password and asks me to sign in again. When I put in the exact same information to login that I JUST did _  it says wrong password or ID. It fooled me yesterday and I changed my password. I am not going to change my password every day just to use this app on mobile. Fix this please!!,1,06/28/2013,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Appreciate quick dev response: now I know that Admin is accessed through Settings. That's a weird place for it. However it can't run JavaScript so I lack full control of plugins. Better in browser.,2,10/15/2013,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,You can get notifications about comments and check stats _  but nothing else works. You can't approve/spam/reply to comments _  which is something an app like this should have down in order to be useful on the fly.,2,12/31/2014,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Awkward _ slow _ clunky. Most people will give up on somthing thart is so time consumingly slow when other sitrs are application friendly snd fast. Needs interface that actually takes advantage of the ease of android browsing but instead is counterintuitive. Disappointed!,2,05/15/2013,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I have tried several times to make long posts using this app but the text seems to disappear after a while and you need to essentially guess what you're writing _  save it as a draft and then proofread it on PC later on!! "Blogger" is a much better app as it allows your text to scroll as you use it and not run into the keyboard to the point where you can't see what you're typing!! C'mon _  seriously? I know you can do better than this!!,2,06/12/2013,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,The App is still crashing when I'm going on "Compose" after the update as it was before. I also sent a "Report" of crash on Google Play but still no Reply from your side. Kindly fix this issue as soon as possible.,3,06/13/2013,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I've never been able to complete even the most basic post with this app. If there's a photo _  link _  or absolutely anything requiring code _  the app removes the code's formatting prior to saves and uploads _  meaning my posts just show a bunch of partial html along with my text. It's crazy making.  I just use it to reply to comments.,2,07/08/2013,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Just typed up a wonderful post offline and saved it. When I changed it to published to upload the post it deleted half of it. Where did it go? Very frustrating. Oh well _  I guess the app is... good enough.,1,05/19/2013,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,Uploading and updating posts always 'fail'. Is this a bug that escapes the developers or are they simply unable to squash it? The app despite its slick looks has remained this poor for some time.,4,05/13/2013,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,This app is convenient for me so I can really get into blogging and alot of times I come up with things to blog about before I can come home and post it which by then I lose the fire. But with this app I can do it anywhere I go. Thanks devs! :),5,05/30/2013,1

App822,org.wordpress.android,I am using the Wordpress app both on my Nexus 7 and iPhone however both can't seem to upload images to the library or crop images from there (the upload button don't seem to work). If you have access to a normal computer it would be fine _  but for people like me who's travelling and having access to only their phone or tablet its quite inconvenient. Hope the next version can fix this,3,06/04/2013,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Good looking and really easy to use. The only function I'd like to see on this app is customise the URL: this is an important function for non-English bloggers who don't like to set the post ID as the URL. Hope to see this function soon :-),5,05/19/2013,5
App822,org.wordpress.android,Stats lock up.  Strong. Comes without brackets after you upload and view page . /Strong . Refresh is sometimes pointless. Also _  same spastic cursor that others talk about when editing an existing post.,2,06/12/2013,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Was working great until I changed my username. Now app forces me to sign in every time _  and it takes me to the mobile site _  not the app. I can't locate any posts and data that were saved locally on the app. Please help!,3,05/15/2013,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,Finally reloaded on my Galaxy S and problems seem to be fixed. Not a regular blogger _  but nice to have it working right when I feel like using it. Thanx to the devs,4,05/13/2013,13
App822,org.wordpress.android,A fairly basic app but it does what is required easily and _  so far for me _  reliably. Maybe previous comments were for an earlier version. It displays the captions for images a bit oddly but that doesn't prevent me from using the app as I want.,5,05/20/2013,8
App822,org.wordpress.android,I've started a post three times now and saved it as a draft. First time _  I figured since I don't think I had very good service it didn't save online so when I got on my laptop it wasn't saved and then came back to the app and it was gone. Now it's happened two more times and I haven't used my laptop since. Please fix this. Edit: They all just showed up. Uhm _  please get this confusion with saving drafts and all worked out. I am glad they showed but it needs to be a little more stable with that.,4,05/15/2013,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I've had some frustrations while using this so on my Nexus phone. I can't figure out how to save a draft _  so my posts get published before I want them to.

App822,org.wordpress.android,I cannot get the most important feature to work on this: Comments. It has some comments downloaded _  in the device? _  but will not show new comments. Seems to be related to authentication maybe and issues where WP is configured with 2 factor authentication. Posts retrieves ok and asks for verification code _  but comments just sits there and eventually complains about hitting too many failed login limit.,2,05/15/2013,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I feel like abusing you guys. My posts still remain as local draft. The reason I'm not blogging: You write diligently and the post remains in draft forever. How difficult is it to get this app right?,1,05/24/2013,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,I wrote several pages of an essay and saved it on my tablet.  It showed "saved locally."   3 hours later I went to see it on the Net and I saw only one paragraph.  I went back to the tablet and it was all there. I saved it again to be sure I did not lose it. Still not on the net or in my drafts on the net.  Finally saw the sync button the tablet app.  Did that and EVERYTHING was synced back to a few paragraphs. And before you ask _  the revisions were of now value either. Not sure how you get it to not Save Locally other then sync.  But _  I will never use the app again other than to read.,2,05/04/2013,4
App822,org.wordpress.android,This app is fine if you just want to compose and publish new posts from your phone _  but it's to clunky and hard to navigate for me to use to manage both blogs linked to my account and such. It's possible _  but needs some major streamlining to be friendly to the serious blogger.,3,05/03/2013,9
App822,org.wordpress.android,This is a great app _  but I'd still like to see some advanced feature. Also _  login with 2-Step Verification fails _  which makes this app unusable. Other than that _  the app is smooth _  good functionality and nice UI.,4,05/07/2013,9
App822,org.wordpress.android,The interface is nice and neat. BUT it's crap. First click on previous post displays the post. Post cannot be edited. Afterwards _  all buttons become non responsive.,1,05/06/2013,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,This is worst application that I saw ever. I give 0 ratting for UI.. One can use browser instead of this application. I mean one can manage their wordpress site using brouser. Because no difference between this app view and web view. (it simply load url in web-view),1,05/04/2013,22
App822,org.wordpress.android,If the app can display photo galleries such as mosaic tiles would be great _   especially after clicking on one of the photos. Currently galleries render useless on mobile devices. Also _  we should be able to check replies from comments we left on someone elses blog.,3,05/06/2013,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,it would better if had the ability to show who replied whom in comments! and if like previous version unapproved comments color were difference from approved ones.,4,05/10/2013,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Good application _  i've been using this app for months. Uploading photo _  posting _  hyperlink _  over all this app is good enough. The only problem that i can't do the blogwalking.,4,05/04/2013,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,All it does is load the wordpress site inside a wrapper.  Won't respect the fact that I changed my password.  Takes forever to load because it's loading the images for the buttons every time.  Turns out the default is to load the dashboard website unless you click the upper left-hand corner.  Upgraded my review to 3 stars due to non-intuitive ui.,3,05/03/2013,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,This is the easiest way to add blogs quick & easy to you WordPress account nut really does need to make things easier like the webpage because adding pictures & videos seems to be missing from our blogs when we wish to add them to out blogs.,4,05/03/2013,4
App822,org.wordpress.android,It doesn't work on half the stuff. This app needs a lot of work. Going to the website it's easier.,1,05/02/2013,4
App822,org.wordpress.android,This app is useless and kills my site every time I try and use it!,1,05/07/2013,1

App822,org.wordpress.android,Recent fix makes everything better. I'm now free to love the new holo design _  the layout is great. I can't recommend this highly enough for WordPress users (mines self hosted _  and the app still works great). The only thing I'd like added in future versions would be a word count feature.,5,04/23/2013,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,Love the look of last update and the new menu but comments are no longer loading _  evGalaxy ery time I try to refresh the notifications I get a message  "comments could not be refreshed at this time." And when I insert images into a post they just disappear before I have chance to save the post and I have the start uploading them again.,3,04/23/2013,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,I like the app overall. Helps me post content to my blog with ease. The interface is nice and crisp. However the last time _  I switched apps and came back to find that all that I had written had disappeared - not even a local draft was saved. Was very disappointed. Hope there's a feature that saves as you type or at least recovers what you've typed.,3,05/01/2013,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,The most annoying thing is when you try to press the like button and nothing happens. Also many features sometimes don't load so you have to refresh a few times. I hope they fix this app because if it worked as advertised it would be nice.,2,04/26/2013,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,I used to blogging using Wordpress. Now _  trying to delete post. Says 'post deleted successfully' _  refresh the page and... TARAA!! The page is not deleted _  even it says deleted. I've wrote a post and it says that posted successfully. BUT WHERE IS IT?? I also try to edit a post. FAILURE and it's NOT EDITED. What a crap? This app WAS great.,1,04/26/2013,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Previous versions of this app were completely useless for creating and editing articles.  This update fixes the sync problems and usability issues that resulted in loss of data.  Category information now even syncs properly.  But if you try sharing photos from other apps to Wordpress _  it responds by ignoring the shared data and creating a blank post.,4,04/30/2013,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,I can never comment on my own or other blogs.  Every time I try _  it either scrolls up to the top of the page or has an error when I try to post the comment.  I hope they fix it soon _  or I will have to stop using the app.,3,05/01/2013,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,The new update is great... But I've just made quite a large posting....  It turns out it didn't post properly.. And didn't save the final copy as a local draft.... Have to rewrite... Not happy: (,3,04/25/2013,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,After the update _  I can't find the "drafts" section. Most of my blogs require a lot of time. I write them over a span of a few days. Without the drafts section _  this app is simply of no use to me.,3,04/27/2013,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,Horrid update with too many bugs to list. How do I restore to previous fully functional app with better UI? 2nd recent update does not resolve major issues when swapping between accounts.,1,04/23/2013,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Used to be a nice little app.  Now _  might as well use the website - or just wait till I'm at a computer. Painful.,3,04/26/2013,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,I just downloaded this app to use with my HTC 3D phone and immediately want to uninstall. I try to back space and it keeps the cursor at the spot I want to erase but for some reason erases the content a few sentences above! So frustrating to not be able to backspace. Please fix this!,2,04/23/2013,3
App822,org.wordpress.android,For use on my SGS3 the old app was much better. The side bar is so small I can't see what the icons are and using them is very difficult.,2,04/24/2013,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,The app is great and all but can I make one suggestion.  If there's any way for the app to automatically save while you're writing a blog just like on the website would be awesome.  Just now I was writing a blog because I was in the moment and for some reason my keyboard decided to erase everything I just typed and nothing was saved. I'm mad at my phone but if there's any way to get that feature it would be much appreciated.,4,04/22/2013,35
App822,org.wordpress.android,If when you open it _  it's like you're not in an app at all _  but on a browser of the site _  clear the cache. Otherwise text jumps all over _  you can't select where you want to start typing (it randomly shoots cursor wherever it wants.) Erase temp files and login again.,4,04/27/2013,3
App822,org.wordpress.android,Was good before _  now after latest update n new gui I can refresh posts n comments anymore... Keeps getting "connection error" message that was never there before in the previous version.   2 stars until they fix it.,2,05/01/2013,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I have to say I like the panels better than what it is now... Not saying that this is bad but the old style was way more simple and easy to use.,4,04/23/2013,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,Extremely hard to edit posts. It doesn't feel like an app but more like a non-mobile friendly website. Scrolling causes the grey bar at the top to jump all over the page. Plus many more issues.,1,04/29/2013,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,I always have to resort to using my computer to do uploads because I always have no clue of the progress of my current upload. This isn't the only problem I have with the app guys something is missing. Wish I could say what because I need a WordPress app that's flawless and perfect like the site.,2,04/22/2013,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Much better than previous versions but still lacking featured image function and search function to find old posts. Looking forward to more updates.,3,04/23/2013,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,not able to upload photos even after making gallery available offline.  in post pictures appear to be added but upon saving replaced by <img> which of course is not enough to display anything.  once that is fixed make photos from online galleries usable. bare bones it works _  but I could wordprocess on an apple iie as well.

App822,org.wordpress.android,A real bummer. What I really liked about the older version of the app was being presented with a clean page for writing. Now the bottom is cluttered up with all the saving and scheduling option that I have to look at the whole time I'm writing _  unless I do a bunch of carriage returns. The one thing I really liked about the app was the clean page _  but now that's gone. Can you please bring it back?,1,04/17/2013,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,Just downloaded v2.3 for my Nexus 7 _  and when I first launched it I was prompted to add a blog which I did with ease. When it came time to add more blogs I had a hard time finding the link to do that _  but Automattic was very quick to respond to my inquiry. Turns out that the Settings menu _  which sits at the bottom of the menu options for the blog I'm viewing -- just like it does in the web version -- houses the app settings rather than the settings for that particular blog. This feel less than intuitive _  but certainly not a huge deal. Once you get used to where things are the app begins to shine.,5,04/22/2013,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,Since the update _  the app seems incapable of accurately storing passwords for use on the Dashboard. All other functions are accessible _  but I'm always given an incorrect password error message when attempting to access the Dashboard. Issue seems to be tied to special characters in the password.,2,04/19/2013,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,Update: looks cooler and now it works with self signed ssl.   Old review: If I use normal http it works. But when I enable ssl on my self signed ssl hosted site _  then it crashes.,4,04/17/2013,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,Trying to view stats but for some reason it says incorrect login (I'm already logged in) or it's not linked to my WordPress account. The "need help" button is useless and just links to info about jetpack,3,04/18/2013,1

App822,org.wordpress.android,Syntax.  This is not an update _  it's a downdate.  Most of the functionality I value most _  such as adding photo's _  revisiting and reviewing posts and gaining access to the 'dashboard' are removed. The new version of the app. having less to offer than the previous.  If you like going backwards this would seem appealing.  To me the accolade 'update' seems inappropriate.,1,10/09/2013,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,A workable application _  however an extra layer of security would be highly appreciated to access your account or for you to re-enter your Username and Password again.  I've noticed when I login once and re-open the app again later _  I have immediate access to my blog. If someone else handled my phone _  I certainly do not want them to freely interfere with my Wordpress.  The extra layer of security could be a 4-digit pass code.,4,02/09/2013,8
App822,org.wordpress.android,I don't understand why there wouldn't be a publish button on the editing page for the app. To publish I have to click 'back' then click 'no' for prompt to cancel editing THEN click 'publish' on this page. VERY shoddy UI design making for cumbersome maneuverability. Please fix this! It's been more than 6 months since I first sent an email about it...,2,02/12/2013,3
App822,org.wordpress.android,Guys _  I really like the app overall _  but the cursor was jumping around while replying to comments today _  I have a hard time liking posts & commenting at times _  and I would really love to see it function without switching to web & prompting me to login just to like _  follow _  or comment.  Also _  it is difficult to follow others that have followed me without having to go to web _  login _  find them again _  etc. There are also places where the text gets cut off _  like in stats & when viewing Gravatar.,2,03/12/2013,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,Ive used this app on my ipod and it was wonderful! Buttt I dont know whays wrong with the android version! So frustrating! I cant publish articles in drafts and I cant view my blog properly. Its not user friendly.,1,03/26/2013,3

App822,org.wordpress.android,First feature I checked out was New Post. Where are all my extra fields?

Disappointing.,2,03/21/2013,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,I like my wordpress app. It's generally a great way to.check stats and comments on the go. I just have a couple complaints. One-there's no automatic alert system (or I'm more techno illiterate than I ever imagined). two- It doesnt show replies to comments on other people's blogs. It makes it.hard to maintain that interactiveness that I love about blogging. three - I cant find out if I've gotten more likes  _ ratings _  or followithout opening the whole post. There could be an alert.similar to that for comments.,3,03/10/2013,1

App822,org.wordpress.android,Works just fine here.  A little confusing as to 'pages'/posts/etc. but usable. As to connection errors _  it will crap out if there are ANY issues with wifi or cellular service.  It won't error out with 'why' _  just "can't connect".,4,02/24/2013,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,This app crashed on me constantly. It is difficult to get more than a couple of photos on a blog and it constantly loses the photos that I have already uploaded.  There is lots to like but this is infuriating. Please fix it!,3,02/15/2013,3
App822,org.wordpress.android,When adding an image to a post I cant set alt text or remove the link off the pic... this app is pathetic. It has so much potential yet too little effort has been made :( can't even view the html editor to remove the link and change alt text. This forces me to use the full site which has a very poor mobile interface... To the guy bellow defending this app: I am so sorry your site is so basic and your SEO so poor that this app is acceptable by your apparently low standards.,2,02/05/2013,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,I downloaded the application hoping I would have similar feature as on my website but the app is unstable _  crashes _  can't do dual view. Too many essential basic feature missing.  Hoping for an update soon,3,04/04/2013,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,I really like this app its great! but can I ask a favor?? can you pleeeease put a password option to the app. its just that my friends take my phone and there is stuff they can't know. thanx a bunch :),4,03/13/2013,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,Had this app on iPhone and it worked great. Tried to use it on my Galaxy S3 and it screwed up my website. I now have to wait till I get home to use my computer to fix it.,1,02/14/2013,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,I really don't understand why I can't follow my friend's WordPress blog. It wasted me totally an hour.,1,02/14/2013,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,I got the _  'Sorry _  could not connect to the WordPress site' message at first but went to the forum and received very fast help. I was entering the address wrong. All is well now.,5,04/03/2013,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Cursor jumped around all over the place when editing a post - went through a tunnel on train - when I came out the other side it had deleted most of my post. Took an hour to retrieve. Kept asking for login password every 2 minutes. Use this app at your peril.,1,02/27/2013,6
App822,org.wordpress.android,Cant able to set featured image on this app. But it is enabled and i can do it in desktop. Fix this problem.,2,03/10/2013,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,Doesn't refresh recent posts or much of anything else. Was useful once for publishing a new post but that was about it. There was no error with the blog. An uninstall and reinstall of the app helped it work better but it is fairly slow when refreshing.,2,02/27/2013,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,Was so relieved I can finally update photos etc on here. Much improved app!  However having increasing problems. Everytime I want to upload say more than 4 photos and 1 video _  it takes hours despite having a very fast connection. I then get bored of waiting _  look at the post and all pic links have been removed _  so I have to do it all again. I'm on my 5th go right now...and not impressed.,3,03/24/2013,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,Was great.  Now _  my new posts go to a local draft folder. Why won't it post??? Frustrating.,5,03/01/2013,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,Like somebody else here... Im unable to login into a self hosted blog. I can access via iPad and iPod but not with my GS3.  Please fix,1,02/07/2013,6
App822,org.wordpress.android,I love that I can draft (or publish) a blog post and check my stats even while I'm nowhere near my computer. In fact _  I think the stats interface is actually easier to understand than the one on the regular WordPress dashboard.,5,02/08/2013,7
App822,org.wordpress.android,Sucks.  Slow _  clunky _  keeps crashing when wanting to view post in browser or share URL _   not easy to tweet a post _  poor reader design _   lousy scrolling. Samsung S2 ICS.,2,03/16/2013,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,I'm not a big fan of this app overall. The layout on my tablet leaves a lot of negative unused space _  if you put the options icons on the left and had a view of your feed/blog on the right it would greatly improve upon that. I do not like how you can not preview or view any blog _  I think its a bit absurd that I have to use my browser to actually see my blogs. I also noticed you can not add/create a new blog on the app _  I would have to do this in the browser as well and reload my account into this app for the new blog to appear in the drop down. Over all the app is visually appealing _  quick and operates effeciently on my tablet _  but the missing features completely deture me from keeping this app when I can probably find a compatible blogging app that suits my needs more. Or just use my browser. I'll check back later and redownload if improvements are made _  I am a fan of wordpress but this app is nearly useless as is.,3,03/27/2013,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,Had to delete and reinstall app to get it to even let me sign in. Now the app won't let me change more than TWO LETTERS of previously published posts. SUPER inconvenient!  Oh _  and editing feature will randomly chop off half your post for zero reason. FIX THIS!!!,1,02/11/2013,14
App822,org.wordpress.android,I uninstalled the app _  then reinstalled it _  and the incorrect login problem was resolved. I love the app otherwise!,4,01/30/2013,3
App822,org.wordpress.android,The app is great _  but I've found many occasions where I add to a post in draft mode and then click the Save button _  but the button is not active and so doesn't save my changes. I now make a change _  click save _  shutdown and restart the app to write more. The first save attempt always works _  but after that you might loose a load of work. Using Nexus 7 and Nexus 4.,3,02/25/2013,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,My site is about WWE news so this app helps me a lot when I have to add some breaking news on the go..... Better than Blogger's droid app.,5,05/09/2013,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,After entering my email address it then tells me only to use lower case letters on log in details. After amending these it no longer accepts my e-mail address or blog name saying that they are already being used. Think that I'll stick with Blogger.,1,03/21/2013,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,After done writing a post it is hard to figure out how to get out of the text area so you can submit the post. How to get out of the text area after writing a post? What is the Button I have to hit on my phone to show the menu?,1,03/14/2013,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,This has to be one of the best tools for working with WordPress. It is a little slow at times but is hard to tell whether that is my connection or the software,5,03/10/2013,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,You would hope that a *Word*Press app might let you edit words in an easy and simple fashion.  However _  this app fails at the most simple of copy/paste operations _  prints text like a palimpsest when scrolling and fails to register even the most basic of changes.  Frankly _  writing this is the closest I've got to producing anything coherent within 100 yards of this utterly disappointing excuse for a piece of software.,1,04/03/2013,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,If you limit your admin folder to specific IP _  this app is useless.You need to use third party proxifier in order to connect.,2,02/17/2013,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,After being thoroughly disgusted by the recent influx off superficial _   1 dimensional _  glib and off the cuff remarks and complaints disguised as comprehensive reviews I felt obligated to intervene while taking in context the overall enormously valuable _  brilliantly coded  and unsurpassed user to interface design. In reality _  these petty complaints respective of recent updates that may have broken compatibility in rare and unique device situations _  ignores preceding efforts and accomplishments for an error that is an exception rather than a rule. All without providing the brilliant programmers opportunity to rectify said error. B.S. still miles ahead as the world best journal software.,5,02/04/2013,10
App822,org.wordpress.android,It will let me upload text posts but I can't see anything else. Won't let me look for blogs or see other people's posts or anything. Can't even edit my profile. I don't get it.,2,02/21/2013,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,It uploads the image and text but it displays the photo as a load of html links without any <a...... /> </a> so i have to edit each image individually,1,03/20/2013,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,Well designed app. It is easy to move around and understand _  even better than the desktop version! Suggestion: add a password/pin lock option. We love our blogs _  we don't want anyone who plays with our mobiles to have acces.,5,03/10/2013,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,Doesn't link to the blog I need to view at all yet on my laptop I can view everything. Just shows blank screens _   basically doesn't work,1,02/02/2013,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,Love the app but I am a notifications fanatic and would really love to get notifications via the app like on my ipad mini.  Otherwise works gr8 on my galaxy s3; uae it everyday. 5* when can receive notifications.,4,03/14/2013,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,I was previously using Blogger _  which was ok. But I really like the Wordpress interface. Easy to see stats _  post blog _  and get a good overview of what's going in. Highly recommend.,5,02/08/2013,10
App822,org.wordpress.android,I gave this really useful app only 4 stars because it lacks the one thing that I find most useful _  the ability to do basic formatting in posts _  I.e. the ability to centre images etc. Apart from that this app allows me to keep on top of my blog wherever I am. Galaxy Note 10.1,4,03/18/2013,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,Can't log out or log in _  plus would be far better if it showed notifications. Very glitchy and rarely loads my stats correctly.,2,04/10/2013,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,This is a well designed app and easy to use _  I just need to be able to see my notifications like follows and likes like the apple version if this app thankyou.  I will rate high if this happens :),3,03/12/2013,6
App822,org.wordpress.android,Cannot connect to the site. Got message try later..... but my server hosting my blog is on _  and can indeed connect to it through web adress but not from the app. what's going on? Please fix.  Thanks,1,01/29/2013,2

App822,org.wordpress.android,I rarely use a computer as i have limited internet access for it _  so i always post from my phone.  Just updated so i don't know if my bugs are fixed _  but i could never find my drafts _  and it wont keep the new paragraphs or indents i put in while writing; turning it into one very lengthy paragraph post.  Also _  can't add more than one picture per post which really bugs me.

App822,org.wordpress.android,Update: A year since I made that comment below and I'm now giving it 5 and not 3 stars. This app is all my wishes come true (for a wordpress app). Bravo!  Now using a htc one v // 1 year ago// I love the simple and classic layout _  but it force closes every time I click on the Posts tab ): More stars if fixed. Using a Samsung Galaxy Spica.,5,12/16/2012,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,Why are the pictures no longer showing for posts under the different topics in the Reader?? They are often what draws you to read the full post. Initially thought it was just the Apple version of the app that didn't show them but very disappointed to realise it's the same for the Android app :-( Apart from that the app is very good.,3,01/24/2013,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I used the app almost every day before last update to write my blog posts. Since last update _  however _  the app doesn't work. I tried to save a post and whole app crashed and I haven't been able to use it since.  Uninstalled. :-(,1,11/19/2012,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,So handy! Especially to share news articles I've just read on my phone.. One thing..Posts section: wish there was an option to list posts in order of Most Recently Posted First!! Currently it seems to be Oldest first _  "load more" repeatedly to get to newest. Although _  some are listed out of date order..,4,12/26/2012,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,Twice now (over a year) when I have reset my password _  I can no longer log in with the app - it keeps saying i've entered incorrect details - but I can log in using an internet browser.  A great app except for the password bug.,3,05/10/2013,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,The app works well _  in the sparse Wordpress way that I would expect _  on my Nexus 7. However _  it will not allow me to post a picture. I like that it wants to connect to my Google+ gallery. When I select an image _  it simply briefly displays "Sorry _  that media can not be retrieved from the Gallery" and then returns me to my sad _  text heavy post.,3,01/04/2013,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,I was able to post several posts and add links. I am no longer able to post or ad links. I cannot change text to bold (or any of the other options) I am very disappointed in this app. Blogging is my hobby and outlet and to have the application start correctly then stop is frustrating.,1,01/09/2013,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Unfortunately _  that's where it stops. I can read the blogs I follow _  but when it actually comes to posting myself? Nope. Instead _  the app crashes _  essentially making itself useless. Seriously _  get that fixed and it will be five star.  Edited to add stars.  Uninstalled and reinstalled; now works perfectly!,5,01/22/2013,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,Won't refresh posts. Keeps saying error. I signed out and everything. Even installed it again. It worked fine before. But now it's frustrating.,2,02/28/2014,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,Been using this Wordpress app for a little bit. I  really like it. It's not complicated at all and I haven't had any issues with it. I just can't wait until they enable full html editing.,5,12/27/2012,3
App822,org.wordpress.android,There are still a few flaws in the app. It doesn't allow you to view any of the images I published on my posts. It would also be helpful if you made it allow multiple media selections.,2,01/04/2013,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,This app leaves much to be desired. It doesn't even update correctly like the website. It's choppy at best. And where is the search button to look up other blogs??,1,11/29/2012,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,can't log in on the stats n most of the time it errors when i log in to my blog.  And after the update it gotten worst please fix it.,1,11/28/2012,4

App822,org.wordpress.android,Its nice to have access to your blog. But it is so difficult to post through this tool. I guess Tablet users may have better luck.,3,12/07/2012,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Seems to have the same problems as it did almost a year ago with posting an image directly to a blog. It seems to paste the html code and not the image itself from upload. Text and formatting works fine _  but any multimedia seems not to post correctly. For now _  leaving as 3 star until this is fixed or information is given.  Updated: Same problems exist in newest version as of 12/29/12 with posting pictures _  posting links dont properly add the markup just "type" for link _  video not working _ and much more.,3,12/29/2012,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,OKAY _  the update messed up this app. It was working perfect before _  now I can't post anything at all. Please fix soon.,1,11/24/2012,5
App822,org.wordpress.android,The concept is great _  but the functionality leaves a lot to be desired. Adding categories to posts is broken so can't be used. Please fix so we can use this app.,1,11/16/2012,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,It's an app that is so awesome _  u do not need to rely on pc or laptop. Does almost every essential thing of blogging...,5,12/16/2012,2

App822,org.wordpress.android,I used this app all the time and loved it. After upgrading the jelly bean it will no longer upload posts. Please fix,1,12/15/2012,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,but not much else. If you have jetpack _  you can look at site stats. You can also review and approve comments.The limited functionality is why I didn't give it 5 stars. I understand XMLRPC can only do so much.  One feature that I want to see is uploading images from the phone directly to the Media Library for use later. There would be an entry added to the android "Share" context menu as well for that.,3,12/07/2012,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,i love blogging _ i love wordpress but this app always says "uploading page failed" _ "uploading post failed" _ this app deserves a 4 star .amazing app.fix it as soon as possible.,3,01/16/2013,2

App822,org.wordpress.android,Only thing I wish they would add is an alert if you get a comment on a blog in the notification bar. Other than that _  works awesome on ZTE Score.,4,01/24/2013,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,This app really does just about everything I need it to do _  but on the website there's a spot for "comments I've made" and I haven't found a way to get to those in the app without going to those specific blogs (if I'm even following them) to manually check.  Can that be added to the stats screen?  Also _  when looking for new blogs to follow via Recommended Blogs _  I have to follow them to even be able to see them.  Would be better if it just linked to their page so I'd know if I even like them.,4,12/12/2012,0

Once that is taken care of and a unique url has been entered _  nothing. It doesn't freeze _  it just doesn't respond.

App822,org.wordpress.android,I use this a lot and as I do most things from a tablet it is genuinely critical to my blogging experience; so kudos to the developer. It's basic but effective _  yes it does lose my line breaks but crucially it has decent editing and copy/paste and the features it has are not too bad. For what it does not have I just switch to the big version on the main site. One thing I do wish it had is the ability to associate pages with other pages _  now that would be handy. Other than that _  great stuff _  keep up the good work. And it's free anyway people _  what's not to like?!,4,01/16/2013,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I continue to have problems with uploading photos as a post. It fails every time. This problem has been around for almost two years and has worked only sporadically on Droid X with Android 2.2 and 2.3.  It continues to not work on Droid RAZR M with Android 4.0.  Problem is on wifi _  3G _  and 4G.,2,09/24/2012,5
App822,org.wordpress.android,Version 2.2.3 doesn't work at all. Keeps returning me to the Home page for almost everything. Stats _  see more of a blog under Read. Previous view of Wordpress as on pc using eye icon is flaky. Get a tester! (using Android HTC Incredible 2 and app worked fine before),1,10/20/2012,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,I was trying to get my info for my blog on WordPress and pressed the share button so I could send it to someone so they could view it little did I know that it had given me a link to a porn site so either this is a glitch or hack of you're system if it does not get fixed I will have to report the program to google play. Thank you and have a nice day,1,09/26/2012,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,When trying to update from my tablet the ap refreshes in the midst and doesn't save as a draft _  so I have to start over - or give up.  I'm inclined to do the later until I can get to my regular computer.  Needs work on its functionality!!,3,10/12/2012,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,App keeps crashing to home screen. I can post to my blog _  but every other action in the menu opens then crashes.  How can i rate an app that doesn't work properly?,3,05/06/2013,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Whenever I try to make a post and put pictures in it _  when I am typing _  they go in fine and all looks good _  but when I go back to the "tags _  when to post _  etc" page _  the pictures disappear. Then _  when I save the post as a draft and come back later _  ALL of the words are in one huge paragraph. Otherwise I would love this app.,2,09/30/2012,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Everything was great until the problems started.  I have multiple pages and posts and for some reason _  it only shows the most recent ten to fifteen posts/pages.  I have to use an actual computer to edit anything older now.  Would love to see this fixed.,2,10/24/2012,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I wish i could give atleast three.... my first tym experirnce is too bad can't see stats _  comments _  reader anything... it takes more than 15mins to load a page qith a wifi connection can't think what will be its speed if connected with GPRS ... please please fix the speed...,1,10/04/2012,3
App822,org.wordpress.android,I always forget that the app caches posts and doesn't automatically pull down the latest version. So if I edit an article on my desktop _  if I open the mobile app and forget to hit refresh _  I lose paragraphs of work. Beyond frustrating.,2,10/03/2012,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Happy with all except editing posts while writing the. Difficult to go back and change spelling and sentence structure. Nice job _  wordpress!,4,11/05/2012,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Might have been a two star app when i lost my first post _  now it seems more broke than ever. Better think of a new name for the next release _  too much taint on in this one.,1,10/17/2012,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,I've used this app for months and it worked well. However _  an update and new format made accessing stats very slow. Now _  I can't load stats at all. This app is getting progressively worse.,2,10/12/2012,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,It's funny how the recent update was supposed to improve on reliability when in fact the app stops working all together. I can even read anyone's posts anymore. It says "cannot refresh". That sounds very reliable -__-,1,10/16/2012,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,It will open _  allow you to write a draft _  save it _  but when you come back later _  the app will not retrieve it. (It won't stop spinning the loading icon during the entire time.),1,10/01/2012,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,It's a good app _  when it works. I've noticed increasing "force-close" issues when trying to access any number of features. Add to that the difficulty in accessing the more advanced features _  such as plugins _  Widgets _  oh _  and the dashboard! Seriously in need of a tune up. I think developers easily forget that not everyone has the latest greatest tech _  and bugs/legacy issues crop up in multitudes. Lastly _  more options from the app would be nice (if they don't force-close the entire program.),3,10/15/2012,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,I use this all the time _  with my schedule _ I can't get to my main computer a lot _  so this lets me keep up with my blogging habit. I'd probably have to give it up if it weren't for this app,5,10/03/2012,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,It annoys me when I am writing from the app and then I can't type anymore because I ran out of room _  but this is not an issue in desktop. I just wish i didn't have to worry about running out of room and can type as much as I want?,4,05/01/2013,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Quick Photo option does not show image or thimbnail on the post. What shows is the html code showing the image location. Is this a bug or just a setting I am not aware of?,2,10/11/2012,1

App822,org.wordpress.android,I like this application but : -When I edit one article _  I want to see it how it is in real _  I don't care about the html code.  -Please develop a widget to access quickly to the post page.,3,10/18/2012,7
App822,org.wordpress.android,I have reinstalled this app countless times. I've rebooted my phone as often. And still I can't get the app to show anything but my stats. I simply refuses to sync with pages or posts etc.,1,09/25/2012,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I love the app so far except for one really annoying issue. When I try to post a picture using the default camera app and Galaxy S3 front facing camera as a Quick Photo the picture always goes in rotated (if I take a picture in profile it shows in landscape). This same phenomena doesn't happen when I use other camera apps.,3,10/28/2012,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,Mainly used this app to check my stats...after the update _  it takes a extremely long time to load. New stat layout is really bad...when it actually loads.,1,10/16/2012,3
App822,org.wordpress.android,Thanks to my WordPress and so sorry for a late feedbacks but i appreciate all of work do you make on WordPress _  This apps now is nice looking and more access and no problem so far. Thank you.,5,11/21/2012,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,What the hell? I can access everything BUT the stats page. Worked fine before the update but now it tells me to enter my log in info and then says It's wrong. Uninstalled & reinstalled and it still doesn't work.,1,11/20/2012,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,Frustrating that I can't search for new blogs by keyword. Unclear if 'remove blog' means removing it from just the app _  or from Wordpress altogether. No option to 'log out' so am considering removing app. Not yet used it to edit/post on my blog.,2,10/18/2012,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,They finally fixed the issue where I could only see 20 pages in my admin dashboard. I can now see and edit all of the pages for my site.,4,11/05/2012,1

App822,org.wordpress.android,One of the best android apps ever! Works exceedingly well and covers all functionalities.   Only problem : The captioned images come with the entire tag around the image. Wonder if that can be fixed..  Suggestion : How about having an offline draft editor for the same? That way you can write stuff whenever you want to and upload it later on.,5,09/07/2012,19
App822,org.wordpress.android,Overall _  a really good app and a big improvement over the earlier version I tried. Only problem I've experienced so far is that the app doesn't sync to the site reliably _  so I can't choose categories I recently created on my computer when I post from the app. I've tried the refresh arrows and shutting down and restarting my tablet. I'm sure it'll catch up after a while. No complaints otherwise - good app.,4,09/22/2012,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Using FB mobile or FB app _  I cannot read other mobile WordPress Blogs but mine.   My friend made his own WordPress and has two different posts & I can't read a thing. Please consider looking into this. Thanks! Great app otherwise.,3,09/11/2012,4
App822,org.wordpress.android,Really doesn't even deserve 1 star. None of my blogs are ever uploaded when I write on the go. And to make it worse _  it saves in drafts - but when I get on my laptop and check drafts there is nothing.  Terrible app _  really making it difficult for me to blog _  as I am always on the move and this isn't helping! Please please please do something quick.,1,09/29/2012,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,Relaxing. Love it on my iPad _  glad it's available for Android now too.  Suggestions...  - allow landscape mode - make a sound when a card is tapped but can't be moved - make taps more responsive and accurate (hard to select cards sometimes _  especially near edges _  which leads to wondering "did it not respond or is that card unplayable?" Hence previous suggestion) - offer paid ad-free version (I got spoiled on the iOS one) - compress piles when they get long so they don't cover up buttons at bottom of screen,4,09/21/2012,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,As I found out you got to make sure that you are using the correct WP version on your site *and* that all required elements are set up right (PHP _  mysql _  etc.) Because this app is "just" a frontend _  not a principal maintenance tool in and of itself. But once you got that out of the way _  it all fits like a fiddel. The screens are simple and easy to reach _  even so the GUI is _  well _  simple ;) Last not least _  please fix the stats option _  as it won't retrieve any statistics when I try it. Once you can get the stats to work and make the GUI a bit more appealing (color has been invented folks _  and tablets are the way to go) _  then 5 stars.,4,08/18/2012,2

App822,org.wordpress.android,...just don't try to edit existing ones. App will embed format code into the text and render it garbage.

App822,org.wordpress.android,Adding photos via the camera very often crashes the app _  which then of course loses everything you've written. If you want to use it I suggest saving every sentence unless you really enjoy retyping. Annoyingly this also closes the post _  so you have to constantly go back into edit mode. Thank goodness I have the keyboard dock. Also _  adding photos does work _  and it lets you set alignment _  but it doesn't seem to be able to properly type text to flow around those images _  so using Alignment None is really the only option.,2,08/11/2012,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,Have to uninstall because of privacy concerns. Should have to log in each time AT LEAST for private blogs and/or make a log out button.,2,07/29/2012,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Doesnt work at all for self hosted wordpress.  Login fails everytime stating no wordpress site found...	Useless to me.  Wont login to any of my several wp sites.

App822,org.wordpress.android,I'm maybe a noob _  but hey why this app is not noob friendly? I have an website. Self hosted. And this rpl. Php or something like that error is eating me up. I've enabled that on my blogs settings>writing panel but still it don't get my what a shame.,1,07/23/2012,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,The app is fair in what it is capable of doing. One error message that I seem to continually get is in the "comments" tab.  I am unable to login to it.  Other than that _  I use this app until I am able to get to my computer.,3,08/12/2012,0

Post is not formatted properly. Restructuring the post is not user friendly. Does WordPress really want a user friendly gui? I hope. Also _  I cannot scroll up or,1,08/29/2013,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,Sometimes when a blog entry shows that it has comments _  you scroll down to read them but it does not display them. If you scroll fast it "kicks in" but not all the time. Five stars if it can be fixed!,4,08/13/2012,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,Awesome app _  worked flawlessly on my Galaxy S3.   I guess my only complaint would be the lack of having things like the editor _  all the settings _  themes etc available natively in the app.   But for doing general post stuff and especially uploading images/videos from my phone _  it's great.,5,09/17/2012,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,When creating new posts or editing old ones it's nearly impossible to get the cursor to where you want it. Repeated clicking in & around the line I want the cursor to be gets it there & then makes it jump back to two lines above or where ever it wants to be. Also editing code to existing posts messes things up.  Currently only thing the app is good for is approving/deleting comments.  When commuting & wanting to create a new post I now use blogger _  because unlike this app _  it just does the job.  Please fix/improve! I've been with wordpress for years & love everything else about it!  device: Galaxy S II,2,07/26/2012,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Could definitely use a little improvement in design and capability but it is a very simple app that allows you to do basic blogging from anywhere on your phone and you can't beat that with a stick :p,4,08/08/2012,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,Another user with this same tablet had issues adding photos using the camera. I've been adding 87 photo's so far and haven't had a single crash. The app did FC once when I was switching from one account to another. Unlike the other user I've had no problems placing pictures on pages either but that might be because I rather use CSS to determine the layout of my pages rather than having to manually figure it out each and every post. I guess if your stylesheet doesn't deal with images properly that the outcome of what you post might be a bit unpredictable or messy. That's not really the fault of this app though. Not a bad app _  actually pretty good _  but has room for improvement. (tested this app on this TF300 _  on my SGS2 and on a SG Note).,4,08/14/2012,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,I just downloaded this app.  It was easy to set up and get started.  I already have blogs created but it actually appears more friendly to use than the actual website itself.  Maybe its just me or the tablet or its just that good.  You must see for yourself.,5,07/07/2012,4

App822,org.wordpress.android,I love Wordpess and have been using it since the first few builds back years ago.I was so excited to have an app _  but I first used it to post a step-by-step with several photos and it was a complete pain in the %~$.  I think this app would work best with media altogether if it simply let you upload your photos first WITHOUT making each one it's own post _  then let you insert them from a gallery view as you need them.  Otherwise _  just remove the current media options altogether and try again later.,3,07/31/2012,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,The first time I thought I had imagined it _  but then it happened again: A draft I prepared on my computer reverted to an older version when I attempted to access it on the phone.

App822,org.wordpress.android,I am using the app on my Samsung Galaxy 10.1 Tab _  I want it to access more than one of the blogs I manage. I got the first blog up _  ran a test post _  great _  went to log out ... can't get it done. The only log out is in the dashboard that I can find _  every time I try to get the pull down menu for the log-out I get a screen refresh _  meaning I can not get logged out. Without being able to log out of one blog I can't get the other on. Any hints on getting the log out to work?  Other than that it appears to work well _  with my first test post that is. I just want to use it for multiple Wordpress blogs.,2,05/18/2012,3

App822,org.wordpress.android,for some reason _  it does not play nice with my Transformer docking station. It's just fine without it _  but as other reviewers have pointed out _  it seems to have problems with the QWERTY keyboard now. Aside from that _  the app is fab for managing multiple blogs. I wish the image interface were more user-friendly _  but for straight text _  this is the way to go.,4,04/04/2012,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Not sure which one is causing it not to work.  I've enabled the blog to use XML-RPC _  but still get errors that I can't authenticate.  I have double auth for a private site.  Using Apache password protection as well as the Registered Users Only plugin which prompts for a password before being able to access the site.  Any suggestions?  I have another WP site that I host though that doesn't use either HTTP or the Registered Users Only plugin and it works great there.,3,03/03/2012,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,I didn't expect this app to be so buggy and crash-prone. It syncs and updates posts only when it wants. It almost has an (evil) mind of its own and its main purpose seems to be to annoy. If you dare to edit a post with the site admin _  use unordered lists or bold and then upload it on the app _  the tags appear in clear form (that is _  using angle brackets). Waste of time. Fits into the new trend of beautifully designed garbage apps.,1,04/16/2012,4
App822,org.wordpress.android,Very nice application. You can write your posts offline and then publish them when you get some connection. I had a problem when publishing images and i I contacted the developer who was very helpful. We identified that it was a problem on my webserver (ovh) and the developer pointed me to a wordpress plugin taht solves the problem. Perfect! Very reactive and high professionalism.,5,04/07/2012,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,Won't let me log in. Wants to create new accts. Not easy to navigate when i can actually log in. Doesn't publish. It's terrible. Please fix it!!!!,1,04/26/2012,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,Would give 4 stars because it has too many features I'd never use but seeing how this app started out it's totally reached maturity. Is it really 100% perfect? No _  every app has minor issues and needs to continuously improve but this comes close enough.,5,04/18/2012,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,The word press app on our Web administrator's iphone works great. But in the Droid _  it gives all sorts of socket error messages.,1,03/19/2012,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,Seems okay so far. One major drawback I noticed is that you can only edit parent pages but not the subpages.,4,05/07/2012,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,It's great _  I would give it 5 stars if we had the possibility to manage media. I want to upload pictures _  rename _  caption _  attach to post etc... like all the funtions we have in the media tab  web browser interface,4,03/19/2012,3
App822,org.wordpress.android,Outstanding work _  WordPress! This makes Android tablets many times more useful and actually productive.

App822,org.wordpress.android,This app would be perfect but for the fact that when you click on a post title to read or edit it _  it just goes to a blank screen.

Think I'm installing until it's fixed.,1,03/24/2012,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,First off _  if they complied with the new Android design standards the app would look amazing. Other than that it has a terrible time refreshing. I shouldn't have to hit the refresh button _  it should refresh when I request to see posts. Last thing I want to mention _  there is no support for the [gallery] tag. None at all. Could be a link or something at least,3,02/14/2012,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,After using this without a single problem for 9 months _  l now have a problem. When writing a post once l get near the bottom of the box the cursor jumps to the top and starts writing at the end of the first sentence. This makes posts longer than about 15 lines impossible. Until this happened l would have given it 5 stars. Please fix it. The new update seems to have fixed this problem. Thank you. I am now happy to give it 5 stars.,5,02/13/2012,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,Not bad overall. When it asks if you want to quit _  there should be another option that allows you to save as draft. Or should just allow for intermittent saving. Basically something that wouldn't kill a post if I quit for some reason.,4,02/13/2012,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,While typing in the post field _  the cursor OFTEN jumps to a different spot in the post WHILE I'm typing. Incredibly irritating to constantly have words inserted randomly in other sentences. HTC Desire _  CM7.1 _  Swype keyboard,3,02/17/2012,4

App822,org.wordpress.android,I had to change my review. Since the update I have lost several posts due to them getting cut off after upload. I have literally had only the first third of a post show up _  losing everything else. The draft disappears once its been published _  so no going back. Also it will not upload any images included in the post. Asus Transformer.,1,02/16/2012,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,Limits the maximum number of symbols in a post. Wrote a long post on the pc _  then used this program to edit some words _  saved. When reviewing noticed that it cut out a portion of text from the end of the post with no way to recover it now.  Please either fix this or let this be set in options.   Tl;dr: cuts the ending if it finds the post too long for it. UPDATE: 2 updates and still no change. This makes the app pretty useless for me.,2,02/13/2012,3
App822,org.wordpress.android,Does everything I need it to do via mobile. Only thing I ask is instead of a polling check for updates perhaps there's a push option so its not always checking the site at a given time. Other than that its still a 5 star app!,5,02/13/2012,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Since the latest update _  all I get is the HTTP error 410. It lets me see my posts and stats but all uploads fail. C'mon WordPress _  get it together.,3,02/18/2012,1

App822,org.wordpress.android,Good for me.,5,02/15/2012,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,This is most definitely a very functional app for managing one's website from an Android device.  It allows one to manage posts and pages (in HTML only _  mind you) _  and do some quick uploads.  However _  the thing that I believe that this app is sorely missing is the ability to manage custom post types.  I have several custom post types on my WordPress site _  and am unable to manage them from my phone.  My custom post types are just as important - if not more - than my regular posts _  and those custom posts need to be accessible in the mobile app _  and thus would love to see that functionality added to a future version of the app.  Likewise _  one cannot work with custom fields in the app _  and that is a bit of a drawback as well.  Would also greatly appreciate having the ability to manage custom fields for posts/pages/custom post types in a future app.  So all in all _  it's a very good _  functional app _  but I really would like to see a few additional features to make it even better.,4,01/20/2012,3
App822,org.wordpress.android,The latest version is fantasic. Much easier to navigate and the tile tablet interface is great. But still buggy - doesn't always list pages properly and crashes a fair amount on Android 3.2 Look forward to some bug fixes.  Update 1/2012 - STILL very buggy. Seems to have a lot of trouble syncing properly. Saved drafts seem to disappear _  but then they appear later. Refresh seems like a 'half refresh' Whatever you do _  ALWAYS 'Select All' and copy before submitting anything - just to be safe. Also _  any post created with this seems to lock the publish time vs 'Now' so if you tweak it later on a PC and publish _  the publish date is when you saved it on Android. Anyway - def buggy _  but speaks to how great the design is that it still keeps 4 stars. Once the bugs are worked out - GREAT app.,4,01/24/2012,3
App822,org.wordpress.android,This looks interesting _  but desperately lacking in features. No options to work offline on posts like when you are on a device that doesn't have a permanent connection (think tablets). Does not find any posts that are already in progress.  Editor is absolutely basic and near useless for anything more than taking a photo and adding a comment seems there are no advanced formatting features.,2,01/31/2012,4
App822,org.wordpress.android,I loaded an unpublished post and used the app to publish it. Even though it shows the brackets and less than and greater than signs in the editor _  when publishing it removes them all _  revealing the code - including WordPress brackets with potential PHP data.,2,01/28/2012,3
App822,org.wordpress.android,ICS 4.0.2 Galaxy Nexus & 2.3 Vibrant content window comes up _  maximizes and when you're done you have to hit the back button _  loosing what you just wrote almost 100% of the time,1,01/24/2012,2

App822,org.wordpress.android,Got much worse. Harder to write _  and danger of  losing post by repeat button presses.,3,01/17/2012,3
App822,org.wordpress.android,App is generally ok _  however I am disappointed that there is no password protection on to prevent unauthorised access _  at the moment _  if my phone falls into the wrong hands _  anyone can access _  read _  edit and post on my blog _  I hope this is something that can be built in the next upgrade.,2,02/05/2012,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,This is great. Supports multiple accounts _  quick glance at stats and recent comments. Other features too -- but these are what I really wanted.,5,02/03/2012,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,About the only thing missing is a search for a blog _  otherwise I was pleasantly surprised at just how much of the desktop experience had been crammed into this app _  and how well it worked.,5,01/16/2012,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,This application almost always loses half the post every time I try to use it. That's true for all three Android devices _  phones and tablet _  that I use.  I've tried it in every version for the last year _  and they all suck.,1,01/06/2012,1

App822,org.wordpress.android,Love the update! Menu screen is perfect. Can you move the "trash" icon more to the left _  on the top bar? Small phone + big fingers = almost an accidental delete a few times :),5,12/25/2011,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,I can't stand WYSIWYG editors _  they never do what I want. Please give an option for HTML editing. The rich text editor is completely messing up my posts.,3,12/24/2011,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,This is a great app IF you are writing or creating a post from scratch from within the app. If you try to edit a post created via the WordPress web interface _  this app will mutilate your post. It breaks apart HTML code _  injects new code tags _  erases some code (live video embeds tags) _  adds tons of unnecessary line breaks _  so on _  so forth. It can undo hours or work in seconds. Be aware.,3,01/01/2012,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,This app was useful in the previous version _  but the new UI has made it impossible to update from my LG Optimus V.   I can't find a way to save any changes I make. Also _  this app (in every version I've used) is ok for basic blogs _  but not for a e-commerce site that are running WP.  I will try to go back to the previous version or seek a new app.,1,12/24/2011,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,It's nice enough _  but it's still a bit crashy. I've also experienced weird keyboard issues with it as well.  There should be the same auto-save functionality that WP does through the web UI for new posts- it's not fun to have to start over after the app crashes and deletes it. Advice: Save early & often.,3,12/23/2011,1

App822,org.wordpress.android,It's an OK app. However _  I find on the Samsung Continuum that the app usually puts random html code like paragraph and break tags into the text that shows up on the web. It's good if you're in a pinch and need to post a quick update but I find I have to clean up the posts on the PC once I am back at my desk. Maybe I'm missing some setting somewhere...?,4,09/28/2011,4

App822,org.wordpress.android,The app is overall awesome if you just need to work with pages _  posts & comments on the go. If you want to write a post with any formatting _  you're SOL with the way it is setup now. Why can't you select text and *then* bold it? It is a major pain to have to set "bold" before you type. Even worse for subheadings. Would be nice to see that improved!,4,02/19/2011,3

App822,org.wordpress.android,I have been using this app to post for about 10 weeks _  and now it has started adding "p" and "/p" to the beginning and end of every paragraph _  which I then have to go back in an delete. NOT COOL. Fix this _  please!  My other complaint is that there isn't a way to upload a true draft to a blog. When you long press and select "upload draft to blog _ " it uploads and publishes it. There should be two options: "upload draft to blog" and "publish draft to blog.",2,10/09/2011,4

App822,org.wordpress.android,Thought this was a simple way to easily create a blog but it wouldn't let me have the same username/blog/url name so I attempted to delete but apparently that isn't an option. Followed all the steps to change my email _  that won't work either. I've tried several times and the link I'm being sent via email just keeps bringing up a page telling me I need to confirm my email again. I clicked contact us to get help _  but it just posts it to a community forum???? I just want the whole blog/username GONE,1,07/22/2016,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I think Wordpress has am excellent clean interface for writing (better than Google Docs or the native notes app). However _  if I edit a draft while offline _  or I have poor WiFi connection at the moment I click save _  my file is lost. I can't even access the version before editing. This means that I can't really use this app (if I'm going to have to make backups in another writing app _  I might as well just do it there).,3,08/20/2016,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,I was continously updating a draft post that I had written when I was working on it on my desktop computer. The updated versions of my post did not transfer to the app which caused a lot of frustrations when I realized that that the post I wanted to update again had been reverted to an older version on the app. The updates made to posts should be automatic and smooth between the app and the desktop verison!! I had to uninstall the app since it's usefless to me in that regard.,1,12/23/2016,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,I had a blog but never posted to it until I got this app. I use my tablet much more than my computer at this point _  and the app means that it's right here _  reminding me to post whenever I'm working or playing on my tablet.   I like that I can read the blogs I'm subscribed to _  post _  and read comments all in the same place. Thanks for some great software!,5,06/19/2014,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,1. No option to set the main thing of the post - - featured image üòê  2. Not all options of editor are present..

App822,org.wordpress.android,For years I have loved WordPress. The PC version of WordPress I always always loved. You can do anything with it. But on PC years ago it got tiresome because unless you got a team or the right tools its hard to code or it takes money. I love the WordPress APP because now.. the mobile version is even more simple and yet I about gurantee the code and skins will be so easy anybody can do it. Which in this day in time _  Tools like WordPress are always important! But there is nobody.. like WordPress!,5,03/27/2015,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I used this on my phone as I preferred word press over tumblr but the mobile client isn't as responsive. It would get stuck on uploading pictures frequently despite me working on Wi-Fi instead of data. I have high speed internet and tested other sites to determine whether it was me or the app... It was the app. Great when it does work _  just has issues with pictures and gifs.,4,08/10/2016,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Konichiwa! I really don't understand why there is so much bad reviews...  It was fine to me. Besides _  I'm pretty sure most of the people only blog and don't make apps... I tried it and it was fine. It might not be high class _  but it works. I recommend this to all the new bloggers. You might find it good for your blogging! Happy blogging _  minna!,3,12/09/2014,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I have been trying to upload images for quite some time and the media simply will not upload. I Uninstalled and reinstalled the app. Made sure my themes and plug-ins on my self hosted WordPress blog were all updated . Checked the dimensions of the image. There is a progress bar when the image is being uploaded and no matter how many times I try or how long I wait...the image doesn't get uploaded and there is always an error.,1,07/03/2016,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,So convenient! Allows you to check stats & reply to comments too. The up & coming next big thing in social networking. Good work guys! And the technical team responds back to you (y) Need I say more?,5,08/05/2014,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I was previously able to view my blog in app on my android but for the last week I can't. Pointless having app if can only see the blog in external browser _  as it's too small. Don't know why it's changed but have uninstalled as no use to me now. Will have to update via desktop. Disappointed that WP can't fix this. I contacted numerous times and got no response.,3,08/24/2016,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,I can not log into self hosted blog _  crazy xml error pops open. Was able to install it fine on my iPad 2 but I really would like it working on my HTC One X because of the sweet camera and on the go blogging for my photography followers. Please fix or provide instructions for a work around.,1,05/30/2012,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,This app is very useful _  when you can use it and edit your site as you please. In order to access Themes and edit the website layout I chose I have to log in again _  and then it doesnt even go through. In order to log in I have to recreate a password and log in _  and then it does it again _  the next time I want to make changes. This is ridiculous. Please change it. The app is free _  and should be functional. I would consider paying _  but i dont want to pay for something i cant even use.,2,01/28/2017,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,When I type something on a post then attaches a photo _  then continues typing on the same post _  that photo sometimes mysteriously disappears. It gets kinda frustrating when my post needs several photos and they keep disappearing as I type. Please fix!  And the new user interface looks like it's opened from a browser. I think the previous UI looks neater n gives greater convenience. I feel that the layout now defeats the purpose of a mobile app.,2,04/22/2013,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I used to love this app _   made it very convenient to update my blog and post photos.  For the past few weeks it is almost impossible to upload photos _   making the app almost useless as that's a huge part of my blog.  If this were fixed I'd really like it again.,2,01/20/2015,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Okay so it logs in correctly _  and I can access the first page of the app _  but as soon as I click something else _  a sort of menu slides up _  asking me to login again. And when I do that _  it gives me an error saying login incorrect or site does not exist????  Judging by all the reviews _  I would say _  DON'T install this app .,1,04/11/2013,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,This cannot fully replace the web dashboard. But I think it is OK as a mobile companion app. You can do all basic tasks _  like managing your blogs _  notifications _  comments _  etc. with this app. I just wish it could upload multiple media files. A separate html mode in post editor would be very great. It also has upload problems from time to time. Would be great if those can be added/fixed :-),3,10/25/2014,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Clean app but has some bugs still.  Media randomly will have sync problems and will show error.  Blog post cannot be published and shows a generic red error notice.  These are kind of core things that needed to be used on a WordPress site.!,2,09/11/2017,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Overall its not a bad app _  but ever since the update my reader hasnt updated... i know theres new posts as ive visited their website (Yes they are followed).,3,04/06/2014,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,The app is good _  I'll recommend you guys insert the post formatting functions in the new post window. It's highly irritating to not be able to adjust the text in the centre alignment etc. Since the app is for posting on the go _  it should at least have all the functionalities to enable the user to do so. Please update.,3,11/12/2015,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,It does not allow me to use italicised words in my title. I hope they will do something. I want to write something about a book I have recently finished but it doesn't allow me to italicise the name of the book in the title of my blog. I want to enlighten people in WordPress that there are times when you might need an italicised title. Thank you!,1,09/12/2016,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I had the wordpress app for andriod installed and working perfectly fine for weeks but I had to uninstall it because of a slight glitch but when I went to reinstall it _  the app is completely gone.

App822,org.wordpress.android,I have used WP before and found it very engaging. Least to be said _  I'm now approaching it at a very granular level _  so _  there's some exploration to be done. Whatever I've seen so far I've liked. I hope WP agrees with me and remains the same.,4,03/08/2015,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,LOVE WordPress.  Really thought this would be great but it wouldn't let me start a blog with the details already held for me!  Used alternative email address _   set up blog and then next log in attempt didn't recognise I'd set up a blog.  Fed up with trying to use it!,1,01/05/2014,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Updated: Not very obvious how to connect self hosted websites. Should be  ---- blatantly obvious at the login page already. I uninstalled this once  ---- because of it. Talk abou not wanting users! Original: No support for self  ---- hosted websites,4,07/05/2018,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,It's alright if you're looking to do very basic things. But if you'd like to use it as you would the main site _  good luck. Laggy _  unresponsive _  and a tendency to freeze unexpectedly. You're better off waiting til you have computer access.,2,09/20/2015,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Hello why can't you guys bring small dashboard like in desktop wordpress? With so little options this app is useless for real website developer. This app is fit for bloggers who can update blogs like updating status on Facebook. Very disappointed indeed. I unintalled unintalled with frustration. Need to bring in more  tools,5,12/02/2017,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I've used this for some time on my Nexus 7 and it works fine except from image upload. Not sure what happens _  but it's impossible to get any image uploader to work. Same problem as I have from the actual WordPress admin itself.,3,05/28/2013,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I have set up my own blog and started using it within a week _  mind you _  I have no blogging or website setup knowledge _  I only had a desire to share my content. Super useful app Thank you WordPress _  hopefully I will purchase a better plan soon,5,09/19/2016,28
App822,org.wordpress.android,I hate logging in to Wordpress. It says I have the wrong password. I reset it. Try to login and wrong password. I have reset password 4 √ó today. wish there was customer service. I used the new password to login to wordpress on my labtop and the "wrong password user name combo" worked there.

App822,org.wordpress.android,I love this application _  but out of nowhere it logs me out and after entering my correct username and password _  it tells me my login is incorrect. I have reset my password and this doesn't help. I had this issue before as well but I simply un and reinstalled it _  and this fixed the issue. However _  the fact that I have to do it again _  is annoying. I've only had the app for a week so crashing twice is not acceptable.,2,05/24/2013,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,Love the way that I can access my blog and the ones I follow at the push of a button. It does not have some features I am accustomed to from WordPress itself and from some other blogs but great app nonetheless.,4,02/09/2013,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,Works great for my self-hosted blogs. My only complaint is image manipulation is very limited. I use this to write drafts _  then add final links _  etc at the PC. YMMV,4,02/16/2013,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,I tried using WP mobile app to post to my blog. It reset most of my theme feature selections to the default. It took a long time to set everything the way I wanted it visually. Now I have to sit down at my desktop and redo a bunch of it. :(,1,11/09/2013,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,But this app froze my Sony Xperia tablet the moment I tried to compose a post. Had to do a soft restart to uninstall it. Worse than useless.,1,04/27/2015,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I mean I don't usually gripe about such things _  but the wait for the posts to load is simply ridiculous. Whenever I delete a post or edit it _  it doesn't update and reflect quickly. The wait is more than a minute _  and during the period _  I'm not allowed to look through my posts. I'm so annoyed that I came to complain about it. Gosh.,2,05/05/2014,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,The app is awesome _  the ability to personalise your blog is subpar anything you can find on any other app. But there seems to be a major problem.I can't login even after trying a dozen times and when I do login _  I can't access my posts or anything at all. Apart from that I can't edit my posts because the process never completes. I'm not sure why this happens but I noticed that it works slightly better when using WiFi instead of mobile data. I tried using other apps and they all work fine. Please fix this,2,12/25/2015,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,I have a blog _  which I can't access through the app. It says something along the lines of "couldn't access.. Please try again later". What's more i can't access ANY WordPress blog pages through the browser either. Are there compatibility issues? Funnily enough _  if i export the link to Pocket _  I can read it fine. But how do I access it through the app?,1,10/22/2012,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,This app deserves negative stars. Why does it need to be able to use my camera to take pictures _  access my photos or "see what I'm seeing"? I can't believe more people don't object to this invasion of their privacy. UNINSTALLING.,1,06/27/2012,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,We use WordPress for numerous products. The app makes it admirably efficient and cost effective when your wordpress driven applications rely on fluid updates from your organization and it's clients.  Nice work!,5,01/01/2015,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,The app never used to crash and now it crashes at least once or twice everyday. Also _  the notifications used to appear instantly and now while the push up notification notifies me that there are comments on my blog _  the notifications feed doesn't show those comments. I have to now go to my App Settings and Force Stop the app and open it again each time it crashes or the notifications don't show up. Sorry to have to delete it but I can't work with a faulty app. Please fix it.,3,09/11/2015,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,I don't like iOS as much as android _  but your app for iphone and ipad should be the same as the app on Android. You released v3.1 and we're still stuck in the 2.0 range. You have to do better than this guys.,5,08/10/2012,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I like the look and feel of this app _  but it has a fatal flaw.  I have never been able to upload a post.  It always fails and _  unless I have written my post in draft form first _  it looses everything I've written.   Hope they sort this issue as I would like to use Word Press.,1,10/01/2012,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,As obvious as it is that a great deal of work has been put into this app _  I feel its development is in a bit of the "can't see the forest for the trees" stage. Without support for custom fields _  taxonomies _  and post types‚Äîand no support in sight _  as far as I know‚Äîthis app quickly becomes useless to a great many bloggers. Stats are great. Comments are great. Being able to actually update your website with new content outside of Posts and Pages is better.,2,11/01/2013,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Gives access to the full admin interface. Makes posting to my blog just as easy _  but also with just as many options _  as on a desktop. The interface works very well. Other developers should take note of how polished this app is.,5,06/16/2013,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,I used to love and very actively use this app. I went to use it today and it refuses to let me on without entering a pin _  a pin I never created and have no knowledge of. I went on the desktop site (on my account) & found no way to set a pin! Over a year of blogging and I'm locked out of my account for no reason. UGHHHH!!! Tried contacting the support w/ no response.

App822,org.wordpress.android,Could be good but its useless due to the problem with establishing connection. I have to reload 10 times for my post list update. Its the same with pages _  stats _  publishing a post _  even with login. I tested this on many wifis _  with data on _  on different devices _  ... Same problem everywhere. Fix it and ill give you 4 stars. UPDATE: if i could id rate this app -5. Its pure crap. I was writing a long post _  but this app only (due to its problems with connection) only saved the first paragraph. Uninstalled.,1,08/20/2015,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,As a professional writer and Author _  my blog is vital to my career as it allows me to keep in touch with my growing community of fans. At times I do not have access to a laptop and would appreciate an app that actually works and allows me to check and manage my blog _  to which I pay for the domain server. I fail to see how this app has median average of about 4-stars considering it fails to function properly. From Author J. Adam Snyder,1,12/07/2015,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I love being able to write blog posts on the mover _  respond to comments _  and upload photos while at locations.  However typing on a mobile is not ideal _  and in landscape mode the post box gets squashed into one line; so seeing what you are typing is imposable. Voice dictation is OK however it can pick up background noise when outside and people may think your crazy _  or annoying _  or both! So I'm using a laptop most of the time.  When developers fix the landscape mode for post editing _  this app would be faultless. In the mean time If you have a WordPress blog get this app _  It's free!,4,04/22/2012,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,Im uninstalling this purely because it doesnt sync with my computer. I have drafts on the app that I know have been published on the computer. I have drafts on the app that do not appear on the computer version. Its a waste of my time and disappointing.,2,05/01/2016,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Photo uploads never seem to work. Just hangs or says error. This is super inconvenient. What's the point of having the app if you can't add pictures to your posts?,2,04/19/2017,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Unusable. Cant write text for blog.Just says edit.Can't edit. Same in site. Confusing and too many buttons that seem to do absolutely nothing. 1 star is too much(6 months later...Still can't add any text.Complete mess.Done my online blogs elsewhere. This is junk.)PS they replied here send them a email. I did.No reply. Zero support for a useless app.,1,01/06/2018,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I got this app so that I could write blog drafts when my computer wasn't handy. It's terrible at this: I can only see half the writing area as the un- collapsible menu blocks it. When I try and write every sixth letter is actually typed into the box and the app tries to close the window before I'm done and without saving. Not worth the aggravation.,1,02/17/2016,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,The worst app I came across. I wonder how WordPress could release such an useless app. Never connects to self hosted site. I can do the things better with browser. I am disappointed,1,03/14/2017,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I love this app but there is one important function missing from the previous version. Read More function is missing _  this means that a lengthy article will be displayed on my homepage except I visit a Web browser to shorten it. 5 star if this is corrected.,4,01/23/2017,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,What's the point? I can log into my site much faster directly through the web than I can with the app. It's difficult to edit anything as the screen jumps around when you try to scroll. If there's a WYSIWYG editor I couldn't find it. It added formatting to a post I had started on my computer _  which is funny because in the preview all the formatting is stripped. I'll stick with working directly via the web thank you.,1,01/14/2015,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I am not able to upload a new image for my profile as i click on the -"choose file" button there isnt any link that could open. Pleae help. Its been a long time for this requst kindly see through it.,3,12/07/2014,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,The app has no flaws for me. It functions smoothly and i have no complaints about it. There is _  however _  one feature i would personally like to see. An upload feature. So that it isn't necessary for me to write the post up in wordpress itself.,5,06/16/2014,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,I have published a blog post one week ago on my computer and today I  ---- decided to start writing a new post on the mobile app. I suddenly saw the  ---- blog post that I have already published and shared it on all the social  ---- media accounts in the draft section. I was confused so I clicked on it.  ---- When I clicked on it the draft from one month ago opened _  the post without  ---- any pictures and half of the text missing. I thought that it was super  ---- weird so I checked it also on the computer and the original post that was  ---- already published was gone _  I could only found the draft. My heart stopped  ---- and everything was lost. Thank god that the whole article was posted to my  ---- email when it was published so I could just copy paste everything.

App822,org.wordpress.android,Wordpress is my free app to post my personal blog. For seven years I have been blogging on Wordpress with no complaints. The only drawback is that occasionally the folks over at Wordpress change something that is not broken in the software; consequently;  the fix creates a glitch in the app that takes a while for WordPress to correct.,4,06/15/2016,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,I don't know what happened. Just noticed today that it's been infected with a virus. I uninstalled then installed again _  still the same issue. I had to uninstall this. Let me know what to do cos I love using this app. Thanks.,2,06/25/2015,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,Aug '14: WP _  YOUR ANDROID APP NEARLY MESSED ME UP by not syncing desktop edits! NOT COOL!! 2 stars. Old review: it often thinks mobile edits r more important than local edits _  then asks if you want to overwrite but a lot of times that's NOT what I want but there's no other choice. Ultimately _  I get so confused I find myself uninstalling and reinstalling alot. Crazy I know. great productivity booster -I recommend this to colleagues. also _  an update fixed another bizarre unrelated save issue,2,08/15/2014,1
App822,org.wordpress.android,I used to give the app 5 stars _  but they changed something with an update and I lost selfhosted access through this app. If WordPress would simply start making YouTube video tutorials for setting up these type of apps and server prerequisites _  support would be much simpler. Dozens of people having the same problem _   asking for help in the WordPress forums _  and being treated like trash. WordPress support system (along with this app) sucks!,2,06/03/2016,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,I'm not sure what the bug is _  or if it is a "feature" but I have been working on a document for some time that I was nowhere near ready to publish...  Thinking that "draft" and saving means that _  you know _  it is going to save your post as a draft _  shouldn't raise any questions.  Unfortunately _  as pretty as the app is _  every time I close my tablet or disconnect from wifi for a moment _  every supposedly "saved" draft immediately deletes itself forever leaving only the post title behind.    Why.  Why???,1,06/08/2016,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,I set a blog for my alter ego Jill Hobbley. But I'm finding it very difficult and confusing _  not to mention frustrating to use  I started adding a blog as myself as Jill _  I uploaded photos _  which appear to be missing now _  I'm trying to find the dashboard _  which you may aswell search for blindfolded. I wanted to link it to Jill's flikr account... may as well take a course in quantum mechanics.  OK I'm not the most technically _  computer literate minded  _  but I've used many other sites with more success. I think _  they've over complicated it for us practically minded people.,2,10/02/2017,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,It's very good. Unfortunately _  my anti-virus would always say there's a virus in the app. I keep on uninstalling and installing it. It's very useful _  so I had to install it and wait for the security to send a warning again.,4,07/07/2015,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,I had the same issue when  I first downloaded this application.  I didn't realize the upload image button is actually really small and inbred right hand corner once you start typing an article.   I gave this app four stars as all its missing is the function to control every aspect of your blog and a featured image function _   if it had those of never use my computer again.   App  looks lovely on my motorola  XOOM,4,07/08/2012,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,Why do you have to have a wordpress account to login to ethnicelebs? In 2014 I could login with my gmail _  but now when I try to login it says "The email could not be sent. Possible reason: your host may have disabled the mail() function." What the heck does that mean. I tried multiple times to login by installing the WordPress app but I'm still not receiving emails to retrieve my forgotten password. It's SOOO complicated.

App822,org.wordpress.android,Learning WordPress is a nightmare and the app isn't any more user friendly. Also _  I hate how you can't delete your account. The help forums are all outdated because they don't match the actual site or app. I think I'll stick with Tumblr for my blog.,1,03/02/2014,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,The new update. Now I can't upload my photos. Media error. It took me 8 hours to get 4 of five photos to upload. I had to change it to gallery etc. It's a mess. I just did a factory reset on my phone. It happened before and after I rest..... I can't find the link on the website for tech support so lame. The app was perfect before. I'm visually impaired. I could see it better. Light Blue and white is a graphic design nightmare. And it's harder for me to see the new app type (accessibility).,1,06/21/2015,0
App822,org.wordpress.android,Terribly confusing. WordPress likes to send you in very baffling circles when adding/editing any content. I spent about 90 minutes trying to set up a very basic blog and I'm so frustrated I'm looking elsewhere. Bummer.,1,08/17/2017,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,I uninstalled this app some months ago out of frustration and decided to try it again. I manage a self hosted WordPress site and this time around I could not even log in using the correct login details. What's up with this app? Using a Samsung S3. I use the mobile wp site instead of this app. Also lack of response to bad reviews is not helpful - help us solve the issues and get 5 stars.,1,11/02/2014,2
App822,org.wordpress.android,I don't understand how this app acquired a 4.7-ish rating _  considering that both the 'most helpful' reviews & the most tecent ones are very predominantly negative.

App822,org.wordpress.android,I would have given it a better rating if I could upload images fast as I write my posts.

But for rough drafts _  this thing has changed the way I blog. Please fix missing features or just direct me to them if I've missed them! Thanks! **EDIT** Thank you for responding. Of course!

App822,org.wordpress.android,Even though I tried this with different keyboards it's editing capabilies are poor.   They don't come up to any of the external editors that I have on my tablet.   Compared to the pc/web version this is crippled.  One reason I would like an external editor is that I have a lot more formatting capability and the ability to 'snapshot' or _  for example _  undo deletions.  rather than sweat coding more editor functions _  simply flipping into an more capable external editor seems sensible.  There are a lot of management features in the PC/web version that I consider very basic.  being able to edit the raw HTML code to correct errors or carry out formatting that the 'visual' mode doesn't permit is one.   Again _  this might be resolved with an external editor: edit in visual/text or in html switch.  Perhaps the simplest demonstration of what's lacking is to run the tablet and the PC/web version side by side.  I realize there is a screen real estate issue _  especially when trying to run this on a 4.5 inch phone _  but perhaps that's a case of "you shouldn't be doing that".  However other applications I use do have panels that pull down or pull in from the side.    ... out of space ...,1,12/06/2016,0

App822,org.wordpress.android,As other reviewers have said _  the app freezes up whenever I try to insert an image. I have a Samsung Note 10.1 and every attempt has locked my tablet. I attempted an uninstall/reinstall and the same problem occurs. The window also begins cutting off longer posts. The post is still there _  but you will need to use your up/down buttons instead of the scroll function to see it. There is also no menu once you get to the post screen. Navigation between dashboard _  post _  and post options is difficult. I have been frustrated by the last several updates to this app. If you need to only post text _  it isn't so bad _  hence two stars. Any posts beyond simple _  short text should be done online.,2,05/08/2015,0
