App723,fi.bitrite.android.ws,This app was great for a little over a month _  then it suddenly stopped letting me log in. All I ever get is "authentication failed _  please re-enter credentials." I guess I'll just log in through the internet _  as that works fine. I tried deleting the app data and uninstalling / reinstalling _  but the error persists. If it weren't for that error I would love the app _  but it is completely useless if I can't log in.,2,05/20/2019,48
App723,fi.bitrite.android.ws,When I'm on the road _  I would prefer to use the app instead of the website. I'm so sorry that it is IMPOSSIBLE to LOG INTO this APP. Please fix and post new update for us. Otherwise â€” WarmShowers is an excellent program for bike-tourists and hosts alike. I have found it to be a welcomed respite _  quite safe _  and a wonderful way to connect with good people.,1,08/21/2019,2
App723,fi.bitrite.android.ws,Good app _  the map is a really nice feature _  however it should be possible to cache the hosts on the map _  once loaded. Internet is not always good/available _  and it would decrease the load on your servers. (check how ioverlander does it),3,03/24/2019,1
App723,fi.bitrite.android.ws,Don't want to be overly critical of Warmshowers as they do an incredible job but just like everybody else I can't log in any more. Works fine in a Web browser but not in the app. Will update review when this gets fixed.,1,06/07/2019,11

App723,fi.bitrite.android.ws,Amazing app I love the app as it allows one to search for hosts and message them very easily. The app does freeze up now and then _  the solution to this is by swiping the app away when you are in the multitasking window.,5,02/05/2019,8

App723,fi.bitrite.android.ws,Great network of great people _  and the app is pretty good. However _  there are a few features I would love to see: 1. Autosaved drafts for messages. It's infuriating to lose everything you've typed because you went back to look again at the map or someone's profile. 2. Add a location search bar to the map view _  so I can zoom to a city and then browse people on the map. 3. Overlay a GPX file so I can see how far off my planned route a host might be. 4. Switch to something like a custom Mapbox vector map _  optimized for cycling.,4,08/22/2018,4
App723,fi.bitrite.android.ws,Edit May2019: can't login the app ("authentication failed") while the web version works. The app needs a fast connection. When I am under 20 KB/s _  the app fails to load the map. Even when it succeeds _  it wrongly says there are no hosts around. This app generally uses a lot of data when available. As an other option _  loading the website in a mobile browser make my data usage skyrocket as well. This is very inconvenient _  because this should be useful especially when travelling abroad.,3,05/30/2019,6

App723,fi.bitrite.android.ws,This is not even a simple copy of the website _  it is rather a very limited version of it. You can't even read new messages in there but you'll get redirected to their website which has one of the worst mobile layouts I've ever come across. "Beta version" would probably the best term to describe this app. This is a shame _  because the concept itself is really nice.,2,01/15/2018,3
App723,fi.bitrite.android.ws,I've been using this app for few weeks _  quick feedback : - The map feature  ---- is nice but sometimes it doesn't display the hosts and it's like if there's  ---- no one (while I Know there are hosts !) - the full messenger system from  ---- the website would need to be available directly via the app. - so as  ---- regarding the profile and everything else.

App723,fi.bitrite.android.ws,I am currently cycling through the Americas. I save hosts as favourites then when I access offline it can take up to 2-3 minutes to find the information that it should have saved previously. Online _  it frequently tells me there is no Internet access despite being in a strong location. Very slow and frustrating to use what could potentially be a very good app.,2,03/15/2016,13
App723,fi.bitrite.android.ws,Guys _  I'm on my journey around the US. Had been using the app for a month _  but then it started acting like "no connection to the server".

This sucks :( Now every night I gotta sleep in my tent which wuz eaten through by nasty ants. No showers _  especially warm ones.,1,09/22/2017,4
App723,fi.bitrite.android.ws,Since the majority of activity that someone participating on Warmshowers does is reading and responding to messages _  its a huge gap to not be able to read things directly the app. Makes its usefulness extremely limited in my opinion.   On top of that _  for my phone there is currently a bug that freezes the app when checking for messages.,2,02/01/2016,7

App723,fi.bitrite.android.ws,Have been using this very useful app on my cross Canada trek. Can't stand messaging limits _  which make it so difficult to keep track of conversations with hosts.

App723,fi.bitrite.android.ws,Just like the simplicity of real-world bonds WS provides _  this app works well to locate hosts without unnecessary frills. Member search via maps is great _  as is one-word location; simple and effective! (Take note CSing!!). Messaging however is an unknown quantity. Like others have voiced _  I don't think my messages arrived in France (only trialled once). Probably best to txt a message to phone number. EDIT: Thanks for the response Johannes - I did a quick test messaging my own profile - worked fine.,5,06/01/2013,1

App723,fi.bitrite.android.ws,Well I'm traveling by bike with a tablet and this app is a must for actually using the site. Overall everything works great; maps _  profiles _  offline storage. However _  like others have noted it does sometimes say that it could not send due to internet 'credentials' and it only seems to happen with certain encrypted WiFi connections. Hopefully this will be fixed in the future because the app is sleek otherwise,4,08/26/2012,0
