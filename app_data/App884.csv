App884,org.videolan.vlc,I don't know but many people gets trouble with this app _  but not to me. It's simple to use _  more when you're wanna watch movies. The issue is on the stream side _  but I've never done streaming thing on this app. Doesn't know all over feature _  but from the far I've been used _  I like it _  and there's to PC version of this. Sorry if I'm doesn't know your problem _  this is my opinion about this app. Bad english _  sorry -_,5,05/29/2020,490
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I have been using this player for about five years now _  I have not had any major issues with it. I have downloaded it to different devices and it has worked well on ALL of them. I first come acrossed it as a portable app downloadable and usable from a flashdrive. People need to learn the apps they download and communicate with the developers that do listen and care about their product. Also: you don't go get a Walkman for free and demand a stereo _  the more features _  more likely paying for it.,5,05/28/2020,812
App884,org.videolan.vlc,UPDATE: It is not just YouTube. I can't get any video to play. Review: This app was working great but I had to do a factory reset on my phone and after reinstalling this app _  it will not let me watch YouTube videos. I was able to do it right before I did the reset but now nothing. I've tried all of the fixes I could think of and nothing. Please fix this. Thanks!,1,05/29/2020,308
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Great application for playing any video and music. Every one should try it. No ads . Yes This app have no ads. It have a cool feature pop up play. That is very interesting. Really this app have no ads . Simple interface. No need to be an expert. Giving 5 🌟 star.,5,06/02/2020,4
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Whenever I shuffle songs _  it doesnt pull from the whole library _  just from #-B. Also when I try and start from a point in .m4a or .ogg _  it skips around to pre-defined intervals. Untill this is fixed. This mobile version is inferior to its desktop counterpart. It still functions _  but at a fraction of the convenience and compatibility factor of it's at home program.,3,05/29/2020,135
App884,org.videolan.vlc,This is definitely the best video player on android. It's simple to use and it can play most video formats. Its colour science is weirdly amazing. It has this ability to bring out amazing colours in videos and that on it's own is fantastic. A job well done to the developers.,5,05/31/2020,15
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Strange behavior _  background media scanning is annoying. Lately I noticed a strange behavior in the VLC app: the background media scan keeps running even though I disabled it. Yes _  I could disable the notification _  but I really don't think there should be any background activity in the first place. 1. It's annoying and 2. I don't want VLC to scan my files every night.,1,05/20/2020,957
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Does not play Youtube videos/audio properly. Many times will not play them at all. How to recreate bug: create playlist with 2 YT vids. Play the playlist on repeat. Wait until the bug shows up. Also there is no option to create proper Stream based playlist _  with ability to name the tracks. Instead you get URL for track names... Now it will not play YT videos at all....,1,05/30/2020,133
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Excellent Audio Player App. The audio playback speed adjustment control is an excellent feature. FEATURE SUGGESTION For skipping forward or backward we need a "double tap" function to quickly find an audio point. Double Tap on the right to skip forward 30 seconds; double tap on the left to skip backward 30 seconds. Great work ladies & gentlemen.,5,05/06/2020,92
App884,org.videolan.vlc,This is the best player by far. I was skeptical about installing it and replace Android's default player but as soon as I started using it I saw the full potential. Now I have it installed on every phone _  raspberry pi and TV box and PC. I steam movies _  music and everything I download on my raspberry pi or Linux PC over SFTP to any device with VLC. It's just amazing.,5,05/05/2020,171
App884,org.videolan.vlc,The only music player for anyone who wants a decent equalizer. Slighty clumsier to setup playlists with since you have to queue all the songs and then create playlist from the queue rather than just being able to select a folder and make a playlist out of it. Occasionally it gets stuck for a split second while playing in the background. It's a memory and CPU hog too _  drains many times more battery than other music players _  clearly in need of optimization. Indexing is also a bit annoying.,3,05/25/2020,224
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I love this app. Great work putting this app together.I do notice that sometimes the proper image of both audio and video does not match file correctly. I have many books downloaded but missing the proper cover of the book.It seems to randomly choose images for file. I wish that was a bit better. I wish the ability to mirror from phone to smart T.V. can be better in scanning for devices and using WiFi. Using pixel 3. Otherwise _ excellent app to use for audio and video.,5,05/06/2020,38
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I maintain the player worked better before the update that changed the video player UI (whichever it was).After that I haven't been able to download a Subtitle properly _  the player won't play most dual audio files or crashes with some encodes.Even after many updates none of these issues have been fixed. At least fix the Subtitle thing _  It's really annoying.,2,05/15/2020,17
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I have used VLC from the time I have known it. But it was only a few days back I thought of the Android version. Installed it.. but froze several times on reaching folder related actions. Reinstalled a few times _  still trying.. with my experience in the desktop _  I am sure that this app should be doing well in Android too. Waiting patiently.....,4,06/01/2020,187
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I love VLC and always have for watching movies on my phone _  but the fact that there is no way to use Chromecast with subtitles makes it so I barely use this anymore. I have Hard of Hearing family members that need subtitles in order to watch on the TV _  and it's incredibly frustrating to cast my entire phone as it's so slow. I understand that this is an issue with how casting works in general.... but it makes VLC almost useless for me right now.,2,05/25/2020,229
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Excellent UI and customization features efficiently embedded within the default player interface..... RIGHT FROM THE JUMP _  PLAYER! So _  let's kick back _  grab the bubble _  cue up the freshly ripped 1080p Blu-Ray format of "Anal Acrobats 9" and prepare for more playback options than you will even pretend to know what to do with! Yeah _  it's like that... ( * * * * *) 》 "Five Flaming Platinum Stars of Savage Development Skills" 《 ( * * * * *) Mic drop _  I'm Out!,5,05/05/2020,37
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Uninstalled! Scanning library everyday after exiting from fly mode even when it's setup to not do it. And a persistent notification keep showing and you are not able to remove it...only way to remove it is forcing to stop the app. Even when you didn't use the app. Best solution...remove the app from your Android 10 until devs tell you it's solved!,1,05/26/2020,169
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Just Amazing. The only thing it is really missing is the screen recording and video conversion features of it'sktop counterpart. Just a really great app if your devices own video player or music player can't play your files. Devs _  please please PLEASE add the video conversion and screen recording _  at the very least video conversion.,5,05/05/2020,32
App884,org.videolan.vlc,If you want pretty graphics and wizzy background this is not for you. There are no gimmicks. On the other hand if you want a music / video player that has easy to manipulate and understand controls that does the job in playing back recordings well then this is the app for you. *Yes it is genuinely free in cost and free of ads.,5,05/17/2020,349
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Works great for my s9+. Does seem to hang after exiting sometimes. Does have high battery usage _  or at least that's what my phone tells me. While it's not as user friendly as the pc version _  it works a lot better than other media players.,5,06/01/2020,2
App884,org.videolan.vlc,A few last version of the app is super slow at detecting new song. The old version (version 3.0.6) in 2018 and it's previous version is better. For you guys who still have the old version and you guys don't have any issues _  I suggest you guys to keep that version installed in your phone. Do not update!,5,05/19/2020,236
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Would have been 5 stars but... The network feature fails whenever my ISP cuts my subscription. Now keep in mind that the files I am accessing are on the local WiFi network. They stay online as long as the machine I'm streaming from is on. VLC however is unable to stream them if I have no active internet subscription. How come?,4,05/24/2020,62
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Fantastic. Computer became buggy and started randomly disabling bluetooth _  so this app gave me the power to transfer my music playlist to something that works. Equalizer is awesome _  no hitches when playing audio. One thing I'd question is if there's a limit to audio length as some of my larger files took a couple downloads to work.,5,05/27/2020,23
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Trying to stream a f**king video URL _  apparently it is refusing to do anything and the fact that the local network isn't detecting my wifi network is part of the problem. Uninstalled and reinstalled _  cleared cache and data _  still the same results _  what the hell does it take to get anything to work _  never had this issue _  and the fact that my phone is connected to wifi but can't stream is also B.S,1,05/26/2020,212
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Guys everything was 5 stars but over the last 3 days whenever youre watching something in VLC and then you change tabs to something else and when you change back _  it doesn't work. The app simply crashes and says VLC isn't available or this app isn't available and the problem persists after reinstalling as well. I use S10+ and update my apps on a 12 hour basis. Please check. I use this app for everything related to video watching.,2,06/01/2020,93
App884,org.videolan.vlc,This app is pretty good. Plays a lot of file formats and does what it is intended perfectly. I can also group music/ video and make playlists. But there is really 1 feature that I feel is really missing. "Sort by date" in the video section. I am serious _  I cannot search through all of my videos for a specific file name all the time. You can sort by date in audio _  but not video. Other than that _  app is great.,4,03/23/2020,1206
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Very glitchy when playing video files off of my external drive through an Acer Chromebook. Freezes often and for long periods _  sometimes audio starts back up after a while but pic still frozen. Sometimes it will resume if I minimize to taskbar then bring it back up and it plays from where the glitch began. On my other laptop _  VLC for Windows plays the same files from the same external drive so it's definitely a Google issue.,2,05/21/2020,90
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Thank you. The app is wonderful. However _  2 updates ago _  i was able to infinitely loop a Playlist of webm music even when the phone screen is off. Now _  when the screen is off _  it wud only play one song then exits. It's so frustrating. However _  if I loop one track _  while the screen is off _  I have no problem. You're doing a wonderful job. I hope _  you can address my concern. Thank you,3,03/31/2020,1036
App884,org.videolan.vlc,4 months now I can't pause my show while casting to Chromecast without this app crashing _  I have to force stop it and clear the cache in order for it to even act right just to watch one show. I'm using Android Oreo if this helps you guys.and it still would be nice to use VLC from the computer to Chromecast _  no matter which message board I try to find they all say it works for them and 50% other people say it doesn't.,1,05/30/2020,14
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I've only used it for audio _  but the program shuts down as soon as it is paused for too long _  or when another app is opened. And the file (if opened via an external program) is not stored in the VLC play history _  yet if I reopen it externally in VLC _  half the time it starts from where it cut off. only positives are that it's nice to be able to jump to a certain time stamp _  set up a sleep timer _  and adjust the playback speed _  but the rest is bad enough that I will be uninstalling this app.,1,04/25/2020,309
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Persistent "loading" notification on my OnePlus 6t for the past month or so. Happens without opening the app. Have to force to temporarily get rid of it each time. Still my go to for casting from my phone to tv but has bugs. If I pause a video there's a chance it won't start properly. Same with rewinding and fast forwarding.,3,05/11/2020,93
App884,org.videolan.vlc,This app has been working great so far _  especially when I have my bluetooth speakers connected to my phone. But now since I updated this app _  when I'm watching my movies with my bluetooth speakers it wants to cut the audio out for a few seconds and then comes back on. And it does it about every minute through the movie. Talk about a mood killer! Please fix this problem _  cause it really sucks having to watch a movie without my bluetooth speakers.,4,04/20/2020,755
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Best free video/music player out there. I have an issue with the music Genre tab. Some albums fall across multiple genre's and usually players like Windows Media Player and Kodi will allow you to set a delim usually ';' or '/'. Kodi lets you set it I know media player reads ';". However _  THIS player does not read the delimiters and just shows all Genre's on one line making this tab useless for me. ...I have OCD and have my music catagorized. :-) Please add support for DSD (.dff _  .dsf),4,05/15/2020,175
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Great!!! I'm just found something interesting from this App. For you guys who love to listen to songs as background music when you're playing games or studying on your phone but unfortunately the song's volume is too loud..you can edit the equalizer on this App and "The too loud song's volume" won't bother you anymore..The equalizer effect is only giving effect to the songs that played on This App. I just found this "hack" a couple minutes ago. THANKS DEVELOPER. THANKS VLC. You're all the BEST.,5,04/17/2020,170
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I have some Russian and Japanese songs in my tracklist. Whenever I scroll down and get to those songs below all the English songs I have _  the app refreshes the list within a second or two and there are no more songs in the library according to it. Refreshing it has no effect. I have to wipe it out from the memory and reopen the app to see all the songs again. And once again if I scroll down there the story repeats. Please find a fix for this. This never happened before getting songs in Russian.,2,04/29/2020,128
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I dunno what an app u have created  _  one after the another bug keeps appearing successfully irritating the user . Screen freezes suddenly . Subtitle experience is horrible to the core . Could download one subtitle  _  I tap on download option and it circles and nothing happens . Should I do the circus of downloading them externally and sync it . Tell me y shouldn't I jus switch to mx which is near to bug free ?. Hope u correct and revamp this app . I like vlc that's the reason I keep trying using,1,05/21/2020,54
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Newest update is very disappointing. No longer able to delete files unless there are multiple files with the same first 6 characters. The fast forward function is different _  I end up hiding and unhiding the UI half a dozen times before finding the new spot where it will actually fast forward.,4,05/29/2020,17
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Disappointed & Frustrating. The brightness seems to be interacting with the video's lighting (I think). If the video's lighting is dark (shot at night) the app's brightness tends to also get dark and sometimes the app's brightness bounces from 100% to nothing at all to the point where I can't see anything. I updated it to the latest version but alas _  nothing has changed. I've been using VLC for many years now and this is the first time I encountered such thing. Fix this _  ASAP. 😤,1,03/24/2020,349
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I have this app solely to cast video and it doesn't really do that well at all. Volume control doesn't work (meaning I have to use my tv remote instead of phone to change volume). Organisation of videos is clunky. Subtitles do not work. I download them through the app and separently (through a subtitle website) and tried to add them. Still doesn't work. Also then doesn't cast the subtitles.,1,04/17/2020,59
App884,org.videolan.vlc,This app having anything other than 4 and 5 start reviews is nonsense. Open source _  plays just about anything on any gear you own. Occasionally has issues _  if you report them (properly _  as opposed to whinging in a review with a loose it doesn't work) they get fixed,5,05/30/2020,2
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I think that it would be great if you could put some more features in. I think it would be nice to have a more convenient option for the alphabetical scroll _  one that is instantly available without having to fumble around with the tiny scrollbar. Would be nice if it was still on the right hand side of the list view _  but somehow big enough for an actual thumb. Also would be nice if there was an option to lock the header bar while scrolling through the list. Still the best media player tho _  XoX,4,04/17/2020,104
App884,org.videolan.vlc,When VLC was the only media player that worked I had a great love in my heart for it. However in its current incarnation it is a gigantic buggy mess that largely doesn't work with any of my other tech. Casting is buggy and constantly freezes. And my number one complaint is that the app is continually opening in the background and playing music when I don't ask it to. This app is a mess and it only gets 3 stars until they fix.,3,03/20/2020,857
App884,org.videolan.vlc,This app is as good as it's desktop counterpart. It supports hundreds of file formats and will play anything you their at it. For example _  I couldn't play .wma files on Google play music _  but VLC solved ask these problems. However there's one bug: flac files sometimes appear to have no length. This doesn't affect playback _  but it means you can't skip ahead.,5,04/22/2020,812
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Great _  simple music app. I don't like other apps because they all try to get you to stream _  this one doesn't push stuff you don't want. I just wish that playlists were more quickly accessable when browsing your music collection: you have to leave audio and select playlists to see them _  would be better if they were available via the menu at the top of the audio screen were genera _  artist _  album _  etc. are located.,4,04/25/2020,416
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Plays a lot of popular formats and easy to use but there seems to be a problem with ordered chapter support. A few seconds of audio at the end of a chapter and at the start of the next are cut off. Hope this can be fixed.,4,05/05/2020,7
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Why does it randomly cut out at certain points in certain movies while casting? Seems phone specific though _  works ok on Samsung _ . But the Oppo _  certain movies at a certain point it will just drop. I'll remove the review after your acknowledgement _  as this could be the Oppo A9. But if possible to look into it _  and fix it _  would be amazing. 👌,1,05/21/2020,174
App884,org.videolan.vlc,When the screen locks _  the app being kept on pause _  the app crashes when the screen is unlocked. I have to restart the app again to play the video. Sometimes the video plays from where it crashes and sometimes it starts from the beginning. Please fix this. Other than this the app is very comfortable for me. One more request. Please include Movie in equaliser with movie effects coz the app is mostly used by users to watch movies _  not to listen to MP3s.,1,04/23/2020,401
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Introduced new severe bugs on the latest update. A-B looping is always on for me _  even when disabled _  it keeps going back to the same part of the clip _  frustrating _  annoying _  and makes it unuseable _  I'm on Android 7. I shouldn't have updated _  vlc was working fine before the 2020 updates.,1,05/14/2020,51
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Found no videos yet _  that i can't play with this. There were some interface mishaps here and there along the time before _  but they've all ended with couple updates. No ads _  user-friendly design _  lots of features (like speed control _  and screen lock while watching) Great work!,5,05/22/2020,27
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I started using this app waaay back in the day. Years ago! I discovered in on PC and tossed Windows media player. Download VLC and it will be the last time you will need to find another player. It is pretty amazing the many various file formats this thing can handle. VLC has no real competition as far as I am concerned 👍👍,5,04/24/2020,16
App884,org.videolan.vlc,It's what you'd expect from VLC. Plays any file _  performs smoothly and allows customization. What I miss and really need to make this a 5 star experience is to be able to change the position of subtitles _  like in the PC version. For devices like mine with 18:9 or other cinematic screen ratios _  if watching a made for TV screen program _  I want to take advantage of the full screen _  so I zoom in a little to fill my whole screen and the subs are getting cuted out when I do that.,4,04/20/2020,270
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Love the regular PC version _  and this app has potential _  but it's just so buggy and broken 👎 Just some issues: when clicking on an audio track _  it doesn't just play and when done _  continues to the next _  but instead it opens a tab at the bottom with only that 1 track on repeat..When watching a video _  you can't add it to a playlist (instead it will add ALL videos from your library to that playlist 😵😠). After searching a title of a video _  you get the WRONG 1 when clicking on any found video.. 😡,1,04/24/2020,224
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I love this app. Has all sound formats I needed. Good sound. Enables you to create song lists and use folders for lists. Easy to use. Free with no ads. But.... THERE IS A BUG ON REPLAY When on replay it plays from the point you started this time and not from start.,4,05/04/2020,38
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I've used this app since the Beta version and ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT! There's NOTHING even close to it. And it's FREE! I've given it one star in hopes this gets attention. A few updates ago _  for some reason _  it's started saving a pic locally (NOT ON MY SD CARD WHERE THE APP IS) for every single mp3 file. 10 songs in an album? Ten pictures saved. It's an issue. Due to the amount of music I have on my phone the "data" size locally is close to 2 gigs!!! Can this be fixed?,1,04/23/2020,48
App884,org.videolan.vlc,The app player is really good. It will play almost anything. But playlist options are really bad there aren't any real ways of adding hundreds and hundreds of files to a playlist you have to do everything manually. Casting is also unreliable with many glitches.,4,05/17/2020,156
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Great app. I do have a couple of things I'd love to be addressed: 1. Show embedded lyrics in audio files _  that'd be nice. 2. Videos sometimes stutter _  and video starts playing before audio after unpausing (noticed in mkv files) _  this doesn't happen in MX player _  so hopefully that can be sorted out. Thanks a bunch for the great app anyhow!,4,03/30/2020,392
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Used to love this app so much that I almost hate going to another app because after the latest update the app just stays on a blank screen on start up and this is so annoying. Tried switching of my network just yo see if it would work but nothing changed _  I'm considering to uninstall it for good but _  for now I'll wait for an update and see if this problem goes gets fixed. Plz fix this app I used to love it so much _  it would be a pity to let it go.,1,05/01/2020,88
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I love The subtitles feature but Everytime we leave the app and come back _  we have to search the subtitles and put them again.... It's a big problem for people who have many videos that require subtitles... It becomes hard to search through all the subtitles Could you please add a feature in which the subtitles you added before doesn't go...? But this is still the best media player 💚💚,4,04/18/2020,147
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Not smoothly working with Chromecast. * Getting disconnected abruptly. * To move forward and backward for 10 or 15 seconds with buttons would be more user friendly * Audio playback has quality issues. Hard bass with jarring sound from VLC is observed while the same track played between VLC & other players.,2,05/25/2020,11
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Was the biggest fan of VLC across all devices. Not so much anymore since the last update. The volume control is horrible on Samsung Note 10+. Trying to play music or video through car stereo system and the sound is so MUCH less then the previous version. Have to turn volume all the way up in car and still can barely hear it. Will be using another app until this issue is resolved.,2,03/28/2020,393
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I think VLC is the best all round player. However _  after recent update _  there is no audio on resume play after closing/opening app. EG _  if I have to pause halfway thru a film for some reason and turn off my tablet. When I turn my tablet back on _  VLC asks if I'd like to resume from last position _  when I accept _  I get no sound! If I accept start from beginning the sound returns! If I try then to skip foward _  the sound is lost again. Most annoying.,2,05/04/2020,267
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Very good app and open sourced. Thank you. Just one feature is very much needed: changing playback quickly _  easily through gesture. I watch lots of videos and can't afford to watch at normal speed and so for me changing speeds is very frequent even within a single video. It was easy in mxplayer by two finger vertical swipe but vlc doesn't support that. Only this facility has kept me from switching to vlc. Hope? And desktop app is great with even customisable hotkeys for changing speed _  thanks.,5,04/02/2020,628
App884,org.videolan.vlc,It would be great if it worked properly. When playing a live stream it doesn't retry on a network change _  so if the Wi-Fi reconnects or mobile data changes between EG 1xRTT _  EvDO _  and LTE it just stops playing entirely. This is really annoying. Streaming is literally the only thing I use it for because compared to the Windows version this is useless. I'm on an LG V20 which has the high end DAC that supports many sample rates and I'm pretty sure this VLC just uses the Android 48kHz default.,1,04/02/2020,53
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I use the Screen cast (screen mirroring) option on my OnePlus 7t pro and then play videos through VLC. Since a few days _  when I play the video after mirroring the screen _  I see the Cast remote icon on the TV _  same as the screen but the audio plays. Updated VLC to the latest version _  but doesn't help. Using chromecast for the same btw and phone on Android 10. Please fix.,4,04/20/2020,214
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Up to now _  this has been my number once choice for media player for both android and windows pc for many years. My Samsung galaxy j4 core worked great with this app until today where it would only open up a blank screen and then crash. I've forced stop the app and also uninstalled and reinstalled but still had the same. I'm so very disappointed I can't use the app any more.,1,03/26/2020,381
App884,org.videolan.vlc,The latest update (12 March 2020) broke the best and most comprehensive player available. When I load the player _  it does nothing. No playlists _  no menus _  nothing. As of now _  this app is only a boat anchor. I will wait for the next update (if one is forthcoming) to decide if I will keep or delete.,3,03/27/2020,72
App884,org.videolan.vlc,What is wrong with it? It always crashes when I play MP3 songs. Every single time. I can't even listen to one song properly / completely. Can't you fix it? Or tell me what am I doing wrong. I use Bluetooth LG speaker (large & expensive) & Nokia 2. Everything plays fine when I use other players using same device.,1,03/29/2020,68
App884,org.videolan.vlc,The big problem with this app is that EVERY TIME i start playing a video (even if it is the same video i played before) it is unlocked which means it can rotate depending on the orientation of my tablet. What is needed here is an option in the settings to lock it to landscape mode or portrait mode _  or to remember the last setting. Having to rotate the tablet 90 degrees _  tap the lock button and then rotate the tablet back EVERY TIME I start playing a video is *BEEP* ANNOYING :-(,4,04/05/2020,156
App884,org.videolan.vlc,The cast button takes forever to appear if at all _  I have to cast different apps to chromecast to get it to show in vlc player _  also I don't like when it continuously scrolls to show all of the title of videos. The cast to chromecast problem has been there for many years now _  I even uninstalled and reinstalled and the new update don't fix it. That's why I only use this for the movies that won't cast with my other casting apps.,2,04/13/2020,47
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I always love using vlc on windows _  but in android there is a problem while playing an audio file _ if i select a video file from file folder rather than playing vdo file it continues to play audio file  _  solution is very hactic stop the file and exit vlc than select the vdo file. Other than that it is ok,4,06/02/2020,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,This is a great video player that can play files from phone storage and network shares but presently has some Chrome casting issues. Phone display keeps turning off preventing easy movie control and dropping the cast. Need a default option to keep screen on while casting. No subtitles during casting either. Would love to see these little issues fixed soon. Keep up the good work.,4,04/27/2020,149
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Lots of bugs has been fixed. but there are still 3 most irritating bugs which i am not comfortable with. 1. Everytime i switch to another app while watching a video and when i switch back the subtitles doesn't show until a replay the video. 2. Sometimes audio latency does not adjust with bluetooth earphones until you restart the app or adjust audio delay manually. 3. Sometimes video list shows empty everytime i open the app. Video list doesn't show until we refresh the list.,4,03/22/2020,336
App884,org.videolan.vlc,It is a favorite video player [of mine] and second best to Samsung's video player (which isn't available on Huawei devices) I recommend this app to anyone. It allows subtitles _  duel-audio video _  buffering _  and more. The app also has music playing though I found the music player to not be great at categorizing and making a self-playlist of audio albums or artists.,5,03/22/2020,517
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Overall vlc is great. I use it everywhere and love it but unfortunately _  this time I cannot rate it high. Why do I have to re type my credentials every time for each folder while browsing an smb file system? Double on that _  even if the option to remember the password is ticked? Please let me see a fix for this. This makes the software unusable - its unacceptable having to install broken software on systems because of bugs like this. When I see a fix _  I will reconsider my rating - sorry.,1,04/13/2020,237
App884,org.videolan.vlc,i only have 2 issues... one _  audio would mute a few seconds after resuming a pause. two _  video starts over from the beginning after turning off the screen. also would be great if it has snapshot function. otherwise this app is all i ever needed _  it's great.,4,05/26/2020,3
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I have this app installed on my Moto phone. I've uploaded from my computer around 90 carefully selected jazz albums - mostly WMA _  some MP3 and a little FLAC formats. With my phone listening at least I shuffle the tracks exclusively. For my musical uses almost perfect. Improvement can come with making shuffle mode more truly random. Add loudness normalization and my life would be complete. Thanks for an excellent app.,5,04/03/2020,53
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Built in volume booster that works awesome!!... Been using VLC prob like 10+ years _  and on a handful of diff Android phones and tablets _  as well as a few diff Windows computers _  both desktops and laptops _  and even a netbook back in da day... Havent really tried any other media players since i found VLC since this does everything u need and more! I've told many friends and fam members bout u guys ova the years. Keep up the great work!,5,03/22/2020,382
App884,org.videolan.vlc,It used to be great and I used to love VLC but recently it started this new problem in which it does not detect the subtitle file which is present in my device(Android). I downloaded alot of subtitle files for the same movie but it didnt even detect a single one. This was very troubling and I even tried the download subtitle option but it wont work either. Please fix this problem and I will rate it five stars again.,2,04/13/2020,294
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Can not play movies in their original aspect ratio _  always stretching pictures vertically and want to use exactly as my phone's screen size. For example original movie has black bar on top and down but this app always want to eliminate it and use full screen that results is awkward. I tried all setting but there is not advance setting in new versions. I tried other apps like MX player to make sure this is not my phone's fault  _  but other apps play well in original aspect ratio.,1,05/01/2020,37
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Why is it that the app corrupt my mobile phone. All the movies I downloaded was wiped out and if I've watched the movie before and I decided to watch it again it will get to a point that the movie will stop and continue counting the time. I can't download the subtitles of the movie I wanna watch again. I used to recommend this app before but now I'm disappointed in the app. I don't enjoy watching videos on VLC player again. What is happening? Any solution?,1,05/11/2020,35
App884,org.videolan.vlc,YEARS LONG of persisting unresolved bugs and unrefinements _  experienced since 2016 on EVERY Android device I use. Whenever you switch to another app and switch back to VLC _  the video resets to several minutes back _  so you have to seek forward where you left off. EXTREMELY STOOPID DUMBa$$ developers for such a popular app.,1,05/14/2020,29
App884,org.videolan.vlc,VLC is my favorite player on desktop. Why Adroid version of VLC is so different? UI is really bad. Icons on playback aren't intuitive. Especially icons for audio track or subtitle switch. Audio tracks are mostly delayed. File list displays some tags information not filename. In my case all files in one folder has same description. Timebar position is in the lower third - not good position fo me - unable to chage. Unable to play VOBs as desktop version is able to. Unable to set to play all files in folder. Need to use MX Player for som filetypes. Recent version started to crash on my Android TV Box on start. Uninstall and instal back helped. Unable to play wob files.,1,03/31/2020,71
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Make sure you back up your SD card. This app corrupted mine and I lost all my pictures and videos. It's buggy with several features that just don't work such as designating only certain folders to be scanned and creating playlists. The only good part about this app is that it does _  infact _  play videos.,1,04/25/2020,40
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Incredible app among all others. This is awesome app _  I ever use and recommend to others because of free of cost and also doesn't irritate with showing unwanted ads. I love this app and have regards to the developer team.,5,05/04/2020,4
App884,org.videolan.vlc,After each update _  I can't download subtitles anymore.. It's annoying. Please help fix this asap as I have uninstalled and re-downloaded only to meet the same issue. Whenever I try to download subtitles _  it brings out the list of subtitles but I can't download the subtitles. Please _  again and again help fix this issue.,1,03/28/2020,52
App884,org.videolan.vlc,This is an excellent media player. No adds and my tunes and stuff sound so much better than the stock google play app. It takes a wee bit of time to learn how to use it and all the things it does but it is excellent. I would pay for this software. It is that good.,5,05/11/2020,65
App884,org.videolan.vlc,This is a very good video player app. A job well done by Videolabs. I just got little problem _  ever since I updated the app to this version _  I couldn't download subtitles anymore. So please review it.,4,05/20/2020,5
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Superb player _  but it doesn't do as it is told. After disabling media scanning it still does it and it shows permanent notification. Instead of being media library app it should be a solid unobtrusive player. Uninstalled,3,05/25/2020,2
App884,org.videolan.vlc,It's a great app really...The only issue is downloading subtitles... It's either saying No network (even when my connection is ON) OR when the search finally connects _ it just keeps loading without actually downloading the subtitles. This sucks AF,3,05/31/2020,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,The best video player out there. It was the best on desktop when it came out _  and it's the best on phones. Able to play all types of video files and all the usual features of a video player are available. Best part - no ads! I used to have MX player earlier _  but since I started using this _  I've never gone back to it.,5,03/19/2020,225
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Using this player for live radio (online m3u stream) in background mode for an two or three years... And elementary bugs still not fixed. Mmmm.... Whereis delete button (or clear) in stream history list? Why this nice player closes where internet switches from mobile to wifi or other way?? Why this nice player do not want to work more than 15 minutes in background? Every time i have to run player and by hands write down url (but now there is memory of urls _  thanks).,3,04/28/2020,32
App884,org.videolan.vlc,The option about fixing subtitle delay needs to be improved. It doesn’t work properly. Sometimes when the time gap is large _  its hard to increase it in milisecond. Manual number input option can help here.,3,05/08/2020,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Doesn't work well with subtitles especially casting it. For some reason refuses to show is frustrating. If it is hard coded it is fine. Lots of strange bugs like playing in background but fails to render again when screen turns on again. App is just frustrating to use.,2,05/16/2020,36
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Plays all the files OK. VLC is a standard. On Android subtitles are not visible during casting to Chromecast. They are visible when watched on smartphone/tablet _  though. I found a workaround to start the video on mobile device _  with subtitles on (they're visible on mobile screen) _  then cast the whole device's screen from the system menu/notifications _  not from VLC. VLC figures out that it is being cast so it stops playing video on mobile device as it plays on Chromecast. Subtitles now show in cast to Chromecast. However _  this is a strange mix of cast whole screen and cast video from VLC (VLC is aware of the ongoing cast) _  the screen has to stay on (no locking) although nothing is playing on it _  just big VLC streaming logo. But the subtitles are now visible. It'd be great to get a fix for this. Works great from an SMB share _  too.,4,04/15/2020,501
App884,org.videolan.vlc,did not work on my phoenix OS but i love it in my windows PC _  the extra feature I would love to have is the subtitle fetching from opensubtitles automatically. More advance would be the auto sync of voice and subtitles _  if not so. Of course this is not going to come pretty soon,3,05/15/2020,19
App884,org.videolan.vlc,App appears to keep running in the background and popping up notifications even with scanning and everything turned off. Been this way for at least a couple months so I'm assuming the developers have no intention of fixing it. Uninstalling and searching for an alternative,1,05/28/2020,3
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I'd say is the best video player app ever. Plays in HD view plus you can adjust as per your desired option for viewing in terms of brightness _  sound _  portrait _  resuming video etc. I would re-download every time if need be,5,06/02/2020,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I revisited VLC when Hi-Fi Cast stopped playing Flac files on my devices I'm a long time VLC user on my PC _  so pleased to see the Android development has gone ahead leaps and bounds. VLC plays most formats _  has great performance across my LAN. It is only let down by the klunky means to build audio playlists on Android small devices.,4,04/03/2020,29
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I was happy using my phones own music player (Huawei) _  then they decided to mess with it _  so I needed a new player. I have this one installed on a tablet _  so I knew it was a decent player overall. I've only given it 4 stars because it doesn't display all the album art _  and editing track info isn't possible.,4,05/04/2020,24
App884,org.videolan.vlc,This app was the best at first _  so I decided to update it to the new version which seams to have crashes. Since I've updated it _ when I launch it _ it shows a white black screen _  Please fix this issue on an immediate effect.,1,05/05/2020,4
App884,org.videolan.vlc,It will not open. And this bug isn't showing up for the first time. My device is Samsung A2 Core that i up to date on all it's software _  this shouldn't be happening _  I am very disappointed because I support the PC version of VLC alot.,2,05/05/2020,4
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Yet another non comparable MP3 player for this useless Samsung 515 VLC like others cannot access device correctly to find files or even have a confirm box to set directly of files stored. All permission forced in settings so it should have access but never actually works acts life clean instal every use. Positive point. Files can be forced to play by using file browser but if device is sleep mode and no playback app crashes? Or stops playback reverts to new install state,1,05/16/2020,132
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Since the last update doesn't update new videos in my library no matter how much i wait. Besides that _  it doesn't allow me to delete any files although i have given the necessary permission. Other than that...good old VLC! All that on a Note 9 with 9.0,5,05/07/2020,9
App884,org.videolan.vlc,3 stars ...everything is okay but the local media streaming..after the latest update ..local network is not working properly..earlier i used to watch videos of my computer in my smartphone using VLC local share option ..nnnn... in my computer settings .sharing is on and even i check windows firewall settings..nothing wrong form my computer. computer sharing configuration is perfectly set..,3,04/10/2020,17
App884,org.videolan.vlc,After opening a media file via file manager on minimising the app and while trying to return to the app it shows 'App isn't available'. Just for this reason i am giving it 1 star. This is a great app but this issue makes it unusable... even after a couple of updates it wasn't fixed. Suggestion- Insert the name of file in manual search of subtitle by default. Editing is easy instead of typing the whole name. Android One - Mi A3 Android version 10 User.,1,04/15/2020,374
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I have always appreciated this app. I have a few things that jam me up when I'm doing them. Making playlists _  and looking for songs is a little more of a chore than it should be. But they're good _  nonetheless _  once playing it's very nice.,5,05/10/2020,6
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Used to be essential _  being the only Android app that could play action cam video (GoPro _  etc.) files _  but not anymore - it just does nothing when you try to play such a video (no error message - appears to start the video _  then just goes back to the file browser screen). Useless to me now! :(,1,03/22/2020,80
App884,org.videolan.vlc,The app hangs when starting up if it is running from an SD card. It the app is moved back to device memory _  it runs without problems. Android shows that this app can be moved to SD storage _  but VLC does not run when that is done. Looking for an media player app that can actually run from SD storage to spare my limited phone memory.,2,04/19/2020,46
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Good App _  could have been a lot better if it allowed shuffling videos or adding them to a Playlist. The app rotates the videos randomly even it the feature is disabled on the phone _  many improvements needed as well...,3,05/12/2020,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I have used VLC on Windows _  Linux (several distros) _  several tablets and phones. Never any issues _  it just works. There is a pause when refreshing the music library on mobile devices but then I carry 56+ gigs of flac music files so it is to be expected.,5,05/21/2020,5
App884,org.videolan.vlc,This app is very poor when a video is played on TV via casting _  frequently disconnected _  really disappointing. It's been a month now since I put a comment and still the same _  getting worse every passing day. Sad.,1,05/16/2020,15
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Best video player app for phones Only problem is it doesn't play all videos when you open a folder if video files. You have to go out of your way to make a playlist for them _  which is a pain.,4,05/22/2020,8
App884,org.videolan.vlc,It lags the video and its too hard to pause it. Whenever i hit the pause button it lags the video so i just double tap it to stop but turns out it flashforward. Its kinda annoying. I thought this will help me watch videos and movies unlike on my video player but it is kinda worst. I have vlc on my phone last time but not like this.,2,04/30/2020,23
App884,org.videolan.vlc,This is the only video application i can recommend to any adroid users out there who want to have the best feelings of watching uninterrupted and high quality videos showing on their device. You can also easily download subtitles of movies on your phone at a very cheap and affordable rate. Highly recommended.,4,04/30/2020,10
App884,org.videolan.vlc,App is good but UI is not smooth and easy to use in MX Player. You need to work on your Subtitles downloader as it doesn't seems to be finding the file properly. Manual Search is completely useless in it. Dark theme needs to be changed to Amoled Black which can save battery.,3,05/23/2020,5
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Good app...but i dont like only one point...i change Orientation from setting set Portrait...after when i change from video screen ... orientation icon..that time first one toast display and after i need to touch that icon again...and i miss that 4-5 second video part because i stuck in video orientation change ....why i cant change directly touch on screen....by the way...i dont like and don't want use automatically orientation by mobile...i want maemuelly...how to do that without toast,5,04/02/2020,21
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I have been using this app since 2015 and it has always been good _  no crash whatsoever until last week! I'm unable to download subtitles. It just keeps saying 'error occured'. And my friends have the same issue _  some already deleted the app. You guys should plesse look into it,1,04/23/2020,34
App884,org.videolan.vlc,The app is fine. But the problem is that if we receive a phone call while watching a video _  we cannot continue _  instead we have to close the app and restart it and in the process the video starts from beginning and we have to go for searching where we were. Hope this problem will be fixed at the earliest.,2,05/01/2020,29
App884,org.videolan.vlc,this app is so incompetent that it leaves a persistent notification that can't be swiped away saying that I'm playing a locally-stored video but yet can't save my place on sad locally-stored video because it's longer than 20 minutesif it's an issue of a budget $50 phone with low ram than just save my place and catche it. I for one am getting sick and tired of having to take screenshots of where I am in a video because this stupid app can't save my place,1,05/20/2020,110
App884,org.videolan.vlc,It's perfect but playing hevc is still very bad.. it's laggy and slow _  on the other hand all other media players work very good with hevc without any lags. I hope you could fix this problem soon.,3,05/30/2020,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,When I cast from VLC Player _  there will be times where it runs smoothly for an hour+ Other times _  it will stop for no reason _  forcing me to recast to my screen. It’s mad annoying when I have to do this every 5 minutes. Any solutions to this problem?,1,03/19/2020,37
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Close to 20 years of awesomeness _  they heart apparently in the right right place _  I not aware of any other open source media player that can handle ANY kind of format & if the file in question has gotten messed up some or BITrot it'll still try. Viva la VLC 28 03 2020 Melbourne C.B.D in the spooky wrong Co-vid19 Vibe/New Normal??!! Dang.... M,5,03/27/2020,43
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Generally it does appear to be a good all round media player. However I have to drop a star since with last update the subtitles for videos played in landscape mode are not formated to the scale of the displayed video and as such unusable. Brilliant for use with dlna _  pity about subtitles.,4,04/28/2020,14
App884,org.videolan.vlc,In contrast to the pc version of this app _  it sucks. There are many better video players on the play store. It is too simple _  I can't see the codec used by the video or the resolution when the video is playing. I only use it because it has no ads and supports a wide variety of formats.,3,04/27/2020,17
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Amazing that it doesn't have an annoying ads but it takes too long to parse the data and there are no next option. You have to exit the video and click the next one.,3,05/18/2020,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I've been using VLC for years on both Android and PC. Best cross format Player around IMHO :) Still works great even with Android 10 and 9 :) Feature request. Add _ "Playlist" tab to main tabs. I hate having to dig into the Settings to get to my Playlists :O),5,05/22/2020,10
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I was using beta version of this app and there was a problem _  this app saves album art of all my music in an unhidden folder due to which album art was visible on my gallery _  I wasn't expecting such a minor bug from team VLC.,3,05/17/2020,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,The download subtitle part never works. How can you put something for our use and still make it useless. It will always redirect you to where they wrote manual search _  even after clicking on it. It still doesn't work.,1,05/04/2020,6
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Parsing takes forever. One is not able to select a specific folder to scan only internal or external storage. Selecting external storage _  all folders are selected and you cannot deselect any.,2,05/30/2020,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Twice now in the past couple of months _  I have had all my TV shows and movies downloaded here and twice within a couple of days most or partial of them are gone? I don't know if this has to do with an update _  but whatever it is it's not working. Frustrating having to go back and put them in again... Please fix this.,2,04/03/2020,58
App884,org.videolan.vlc,There's some problems with the A-B Playback _  with the button not changing when you disable it after using it _  Another thing that kind of annoys me is when I do the repeat song option _  it only stays on that song when trying to advance my current list of songs. Other than that _  love the app,4,04/20/2020,30
App884,org.videolan.vlc,This has been my "go-to" app for years for media files. However _  it's UI has become somewhat cranky lately. Sometimes the Play All button doesn't show up. In the 3.2.11 release on my Samsung _  if I move app from internal memory to SD Card the UI disappears entirely until I move it back.,3,04/20/2020,26
App884,org.videolan.vlc,The best app ever. I have downloaded many anime such as Naruto Shippuden _  One Piece and many more. This was the perfect app to watch all of them. I also listen to music I downloaded on VLC for Android rather than listening it on google play music and it was very great! But I think this app would be more awesome if you add a lyrics download for music just like the subtitles download for video. Other than that it was an AWESOME APP! Highly Recommended!,5,04/29/2020,21
App884,org.videolan.vlc,It's a great video player. I loved it. Some features which can be included in next release are 1. FAB button in the home screen for playing/resuming last played video. 2. Auto playing next video in the same folder.,4,05/23/2020,3
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Last update is to bad when i play video song or any other video into audio it come back and the audio player hide please fix it,1,05/31/2020,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,This player plays FLAC and M4A flawlessly and doesn't seem to care about bitrate. Can be clunky as a music player _  but once you've set up your playlist _  it's good to go.,5,06/02/2020,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,It's good but I'm experiencing the following bug: The last second of every song is cut by the player. This is especially annoying when the songs on an album are composed such that they transition nicely from one song to the next (at least with a good player they do) PLS FIX ASAP !!!,4,04/13/2020,12
App884,org.videolan.vlc,This is the best video player app no doubt.. but there's a issue going on with the app lately.. I can't download subtitles.. I've uninstalled the app and reinstalled it again multiples times it's still the same thing.. and it's pissing me off here.. Pls do something about it.. thank you,3,04/11/2020,12
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I don't know what's going on _  but this has been my apps for many many years. Even on my laptop. Sense this new update _  it doesn't even cast.. It recycles on the main page _  by it self. An it doesn't go into portrait mode.. this is weird an crazy. Not like VLC..,2,04/27/2020,17
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Best vedio player for watching movies. Some of the best features are downloading subtitle _  it also maximize the volume upto 200. Suggestions: after downloading the subtitles we need to unzip it then need to select the subtitle _  some convenient should offer in this process so that it can we accomplish seamlessly,5,04/30/2020,25
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Great app. No ads. Never annoys me. It's such a good app. One of the best on Google Play Store. Only one problem; if I resume a paused video _  the sound doesn't come for a second and then it's all okay.,5,05/19/2020,29

App884,org.videolan.vlc,Nice UI and it plays all the formats I need it to. I took away one star _  however _  since you cannot edit playlists; you have to manually remove and add songs in whatever you want them to be ordered instead of moving the songs within the playlist. Please add the ability to move songs within playlists without having to delete them from the playlist. Edit: It has been added. Thank you.,5,03/12/2020,121

App884,org.videolan.vlc,The new updates are terrible. They make the product almost completely unusable compared to previous versions. It should not take 10 seconds or more to load a playlist _  and I don't care how many tracks there are on the playlist. Playlists linger after I have tried to delete them. The only thing the updates have fixed is blank playlists showing up. That's still simply not good enough if the trade off is an app that lags so much you're considering using the crappy pre-installed app. Nonsense.,2,03/18/2020,264

App884,org.videolan.vlc,Was once the best player on the market but I guess too much customers overwhelmed the developers. The play as audio function sucks. It records where you stopped while playing the file and the next time you open that file _  it starts from that point. Only problem is that it will start from that point forever until you delete and re upload the file to your system. And the cycle continues. When you turn this "remember last play position" off _  the app disobeys you _  nothing happens.,1,03/30/2020,528

App884,org.videolan.vlc,I love VLC. Had it for years on my PC. On the phone Ive stuck with it while it develops and improves. My only problems on the phone are two things. Firstly the auto volume reduction when it thinks the vol is too high. It would be great to disable this. Why ? Because I dont just feed it to headphones. I play back through a Hifi system and its annoying it randomly reduces the volume withiut warning. Two. The auto scrolling of file titles. Really _  really annoying when they are long !!!!,5,03/17/2020,251

App884,org.videolan.vlc,Latest updates have ruined the performance. Scrolling backward n forward either pauses or jumps randomly anywhere. I dont know why it remembers some random duration of a video played and then plays it from the same spot again and again when put on replay. Scrolling within 10s of interval.. a stupid update.. now i have to stupidly watch the video 10s backward before reaching an exact time.. extremely irritating when watching some long lectures or presentation. Screen orientation is also bad now.,1,03/17/2020,119

The people complaining about VLC not working any more after switching to a new device are being inconsiderate towards the app since it's not possible for the developers to test every single Android devices in existence to see if they app works or not with your devices.

App884,org.videolan.vlc,I thought I would explain further now that 3 weeks have gone by and I haven't seen any changes to the subtitle issue. First I should say I am using VLC on my Sony Android TV. Before the latest update it was easy to add in a saved subtitle file (SRT) using the TV remote. You could navigate to the file and press OK and it would be added to the movie. After the update _  using the remote _  you can navigate to the subtitle file _  but you can't move the cursor to highlight the file and select it. The only way you can do this is by using a mouse (a real pain). Further _  before when you selected the file you got a pop-up saying the subtitle had been added _  now no indication. Sure hope someone reads this and fixes it with the next release as it is really spoiling an otherwise great app.,3,12/30/2019,205
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I have tried several different players and this one has been the best of them all . I even use/used it on my CPU _  which recently passed away 😢😭😤 .

VLC had codecs that others didn't  _  and when I found it BAM BABY !! The music file played just great! I've not had any problems with VLC on my CPU or my phone  _  so it gets 5 stars from me !,5,12/30/2019,212

App884,org.videolan.vlc,This is a good app I just don't know why you changed the layout in the recent update.

I really like it I just prefer how it looked before. Thanks to the team for always trying to improve,4,12/30/2019,88
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Renouncing two stars from my previous review. Apps usually get better with the updates _  but this one got worse. Reorganizing UI is not everything. The "10 sec skip" by double tap is not working properly. It works sometimes or should I say luckily. So kindly make it work again for better experience. Because it is quite annoying when you double tou skip and it does nothing. I hope you will fix this soon. Edit: the issue is fixed and it yet again has become a great app!

App884,org.videolan.vlc,I've been using VLC for years _  desktop and android versions. Since the latest update _  i've been having a little trouble with screen ratio not auto adjusting on my Acer Chromebook 15. Once I load a video it will play but the bottom of the screen is cut off (where the play button is) in which I have to manually press pause than play again to fix the aspect ratio of the screen size.

App884,org.videolan.vlc,This used to be the best video player app. Not any more.

Additionally _  with the current video layout _  if i am in a folder with whole tv season _  say 20 episodes _  they are shown on multiple lines. When i get to the last video in a line _  i click arrow across to get to the next episode _  but it goes nowhere. I have to arrow down to the next line then scroll back across to get the the next episode. I would prefer the option to go back to the previous layout with videos all shown on one line.

App884,org.videolan.vlc,I love Vlc _  been using it for years but recently when i cast from it _  it plays perfectly for 40mins to an hour then it stops.. It will refuse to recast and this problem continues forever until the next day.. Can you fix this..? Whats going on..?,1,03/20/2020,8
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Previous phones and installations usually worked except for feature removals. OnePlus 7 Pro doesn't. Everything since the last update claims a Xvid codec needed. Even audio and windows vid files. Uninstall and reinstall for same result.,1,04/22/2020,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I use this app through my Nvidia Shield and it was fine until recently. Now _  when I attempt to locate a movie to play on my ext HD _  it will find them at first but by the time I'm getting into the Hs it starts skipping some until there's nothing left around the Ms. It's random each time too. If you have no intention of using this with an external hard drive _  this is a fine player,3,12/30/2019,92
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Sometimes VLC closes for no reason _  even if I set it on high priority _  always on. The "random/ shuffle play mode" in a playlist keeps playing same songs (some several times) and completely ignores others. It does not remember what playlist / song was playing last time you used it. For example I listened a playlist for an hour. Paused it (didn't close the app) for an hour or two. Wanted to continue listening. VLC opens in home screen mode _  "what would you like to listen to today?". Not cool.,3,01/11/2020,721
App884,org.videolan.vlc,The best media player that exists... With few bugs here and there!!! But the bugs doesn't bother much _  It would be nice if I can save the playback speed of individual song... Please bring it in the next updates.... Thanks a lot for this awesome player,4,03/09/2020,158

App884,org.videolan.vlc,Here's a use case: Background play is enabled. I start playing a folder filled with both audio AND video files _  then lock the screen. Works fine until the audio files are played. But when a video is played _  it stops playing _  until I unlock and select "Play as audio". Solution _  sorta: Activate the "Play as audio" option automatically when two conditions are met 1. The phone is locked 2. Next file to be played is a video i.e. in a playlist containing mixed media. VLC Rocks!,5,01/04/2020,40
App884,org.videolan.vlc,In the past I would have rated this a 5. A recent update plays my audiobooks for a couple of minutes then crashes. It worked perfectly before the update. It is now unusable but have been generous with the rating and will edit to 5 once the bug has been fixed Devs _  if you would like a copy of the audio files in question that crash then please get in touch,3,01/01/2020,113
App884,org.videolan.vlc,VLC was always one of the best until it hit the Android OS. I'm taking 1 star because it doesn't always save my location in a video after closing the app. If I close it off while projecting my phone to my tv _  it usually doesn't save. It's annoying so I wouldn't mind a bookmark feature eventually. You can bookmark on the desktop version so I don't know why Android doesn't have it.,4,01/14/2020,73
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Actually one of the best. The app is perfect in every way.,5,04/09/2020,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Seek track is impossible to use. Whether I hold the fast forward or rewind button _  tap the progress bar _  drag the dot on the progress bar _  or input seek time manually _  nothing works. The behavior is erratic. This app is impossible to use for listening to audiobooks. 8 hours in one sitting with no breaks isn't reasonable _  but required for this app to function. I've spent less time listening and more time seeking the spot I left off at. Awful!,2,02/03/2020,1017

App884,org.videolan.vlc,I mainly use the app to stream to a chromecast from my NAS drive. Unfortunately _  this app is by far the worst for streaming and has been for some time. It constantly locks up and I have to reset my chromecast _  this does not happen for any other apps. Playback of local files is fine _  but as stated _  my main use case is streaming and I believe a lot more developing needs to be put into strengthening the streaming capabilities of this app.,2,01/07/2020,215
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Clean interface _  intuitive navigation _  plenty of features _  no ads _  incredibly user-friendly. Edit: The subtitles do not load in the middle _  only if you have playback running where the subtitle first appears. On my device _  subtitle settings change nothing Pulling from the edge of the device for drop-down menus affects the app(changing volume/brightness) _  like if you wanted to turn on wifi from the top menu. Scrubbing is not intuitive,3,01/07/2020,97
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I was just watching a couple of hours ago and using the next/forward button _  which is to the right of the play/pause button _  like how it is on most players. Now _  the forward button is gone and the landscape/portrait mode replaced it. And there is nothing in the options menu to bring it back. What the heck are you doing? VLC gets worse instead of better. I'm using X Player until you fix things. ALL PLAYERS SHOULD HAVE THE BACK / PLAY / FORWARD BUTTONS IN THAT ORIENTATION. Quit fooling around!!!,1,01/26/2020,546
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Top notch app. Nearly does it all. I really appreciate the modern and streamline UI. Audio and video support is superb and all major codecs are supported. One feature I would like to see in the future is the ability to have cover art displayed while streaming online radio playlists similar to that with the Poweramp app. Nevertheless _  I would recommend this app as a daily driver.,5,12/21/2019,1985
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I love this app _  well ported for Android! However _  it's created a thumbnails database of over 500MB _  which seems unnecessary given that Android already has thumbnails for the files (I think?) _  and/but also that most of these files are audio so VLC must have made a thumbnail for every track using its artwork. This is massively redundant! And has made my phone unusable due to storage limitations. Please fix this :( I've uninstalled everything else that I can cope without.,4,01/01/2020,92
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Sadly _  this app does not live up to it's desktop reputation. It always starts at full blast on volume. It ignores the current volume settings on the phone. Once you gently tap the volume down button _  it jumps to the were it should be. When listening to a playlist _  there is no random or repeat button on the screen.,2,01/12/2020,54

App884,org.videolan.vlc,The update is not loading all the music on my SD card. Only loads about 100 and I have 2000. Also very slow to load. I want to roll back cause VLC was working fine before. If it ain't broke _  don't fix it. This is ridiculous. Everytime you'll release and update it's broken. Test the thing properly. Keeps crashing now,1,01/02/2020,330
App884,org.videolan.vlc,VLC plays all types of media files _  including many with unusual or advanced audio formats. Playback is always smooth. Video and audio are synced most of the time _  except when streaming to a Fire Stick or using the Fire Stick version of this app. Another MAJOR shortcoming is when streaming .MKV files containing DTS or Dolby Digital audio to a Chromecast. The auto remains synced but _  the app downgrades the audio to 2.0 channel stereo and removes the bass channel. Other similar apps don't do that.,3,01/15/2020,25
App884,org.videolan.vlc,My go to when it comes to a 3rd party media player _  but I've had a few issues. Mostly with background playback _  in other apps and screen locked _  where it would continue to play for a few seconds _  and then go silent _  opening with no media queued. EDIT OF THE EDIT: Also doesn't seem to happen over Bluetooth all that much _  primarily over analog earphones.,3,02/06/2020,214
App884,org.videolan.vlc,The BEST Android video player available PERIOD! VLC plays every type of video available on your device _  phone or tablet _  when you want it and does it FLAWLESSLY! I have used VLC Player on my PC _  phone _  & tablet for years. I have tried lots of media players over the years. Stop messing with codec downloads. Get the COMPLETE PACKAGE with VLC Player. When new codecs become available _  they will be in the updates. I haven't used another video player in YEARS!,5,01/25/2020,64

App884,org.videolan.vlc,After the new update half the features don't work _  The UI Was polished tho _  So I guess that's a plus Scratch That _  as of 9th Jan 2020 - All the features I used VLC for no longer work. It doesn't save the last played video in playlist doesn't save my position in a video I was playing _  doesn't move to the next episode in a playlist. Doesn't let me get into some menus. It's officially unusable.,1,01/09/2020,62

App884,org.videolan.vlc,IT SUDDENLY STOPS THE VIDEO WHEN I DRAG SEEK (only drag seeks) and it's mildly infuriating. It should keep playing without interruption when I drag seek. That's how it is in the previous versions. It doesn't happen everytime but 85% of the time _  it does. Huawei Pro Lite (model doesn't even matter since my friends with different phones have this problem too),2,01/08/2020,66
App884,org.videolan.vlc,The newer updates have made using the fast forward/rewind _  volume control _  pause/play _  etc into a nightmare of triggering issues. I'll try and swipe the volume up and oh look I've fast forwarded. If I try to go further away from the fast forward trigger area for volume up I pause it. You have the rewind/fast forward as a single click trigger instead of the original double. Makes controlling the player a nightmare now.,1,01/18/2020,50
App884,org.videolan.vlc,This is the greatest app for playing videos in the background. I have tried 100 apps or more for my android and most were not compatible to Androids over 7 and mine is a nine.

App884,org.videolan.vlc,Its a cool app. Pretty much does everything it needs to do except two things which is beginning to bug me. 1.

Files would randomly disappear from the home page when i just watched them meaning i have to navigate through my folders to find it again. Even when i play that file again in the folder it still wouldnt go on the home screen. Pls fix. Thanks,4,01/27/2020,66

App884,org.videolan.vlc,Good media player for local storage _  but frequently fails to browse network and load directories or play music _  especially if connection is a bit slow.

App884,org.videolan.vlc,I would've given 5 stars _  but the shuffle algorithm sucks. It will choose from the same limited number of albums _  even though I have a few hundred to choose from on my local network and it will play the first song from that album instead of being random. Sort this out and I'll change my rating as I think the sound quality is great on your app.,3,02/29/2020,623

App884,org.videolan.vlc,VLC for Android just isn't up to the standards of its PC counterpart. No matter what android device Ive used _  I always run into some sort of hindrance when playing videos. Sound cutting out and not reappearing until I exit _  video cutting out or distorting _  etc etc. It finds a way to ruin anything I watch. Unfortunately VLC is the only half decent app to support some of the less common video formats so you're forced to deal with its many shortcomings.,2,02/09/2020,107

App884,org.videolan.vlc,20200111 - Lowered stars from 4 down to 3 on weakness of internet Stream interface. Does not maintain Audio track play order when connected to Chromecast Audio sinks - audio tracks randomly start and stop. Additionally _  internet Stream interface is weak _  at best.

App884,org.videolan.vlc,Some high resolution videos are not playing. On opening the video its saying to use another app called PLAYIT. I am using this app for long time and I love it.

Please help me.,4,02/12/2020,44
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I use this for casting to my Chromecast _  it works great but the controls are a bit clunky. The controls also disappear after a couple seconds as if you're watching a full screen video which seems a bit pointless in cast mode. I'd like to see it change to more of a remote control during this _  Including skip by 10 seconds etc...,3,02/20/2020,73
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I use this app to connect with my families main computer that has a shared hard drive of movies and shows _  since this update with the SMB authentication I have been unable to connect as no password username combo is working and so _  has made this app useless to me until it's fixed _  which I hope they do as I still really like VLC as a whole and have been using it since I was a kid,1,01/09/2020,32

App884,org.videolan.vlc,The Playlist experience is broken. If I change a Playlist _  it doesn't auto-save like Microsoft Groove did. So I have to save the Playlist again. Except when I save over the existing Playlist _  it appends the tracks to the existing Playlist instead of replacing the original list. So I have a playksit of 653 tracks because of that. That's not good software design. Just make Playlists automatically save if you remove tracks from them _  or have saving work like everywhere else in software& overwrite,2,02/07/2020,174
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Its good to be a ad free player. One goodness aganist all terrible things. 1. No exit button 2. If video have inbuilt subs it wont show up I need to download again! 3.

And that toi every single time I open the App. All I can find peace is U dont kill user by bombing Ads.,1,02/15/2020,58
App884,org.videolan.vlc,With every update VLC becomes more unusable than the previous updates that predated it. Every video will have an issue such as macro blocking _  audio suddenly turning off _  or the video just randomly shutting off. Trying to cast video to a chromecast will result in _  maybe if your lucky _  one to two minutes of play time before the video shuts itself down. Videolabs should probably just remove their app from the play store since they obviously don't care anymore.,1,02/16/2020,268
App884,org.videolan.vlc,After using the FTP connection on the iOS version I am unable to get a connection with the android version _  blank screen. Firstly there is no password field (unlike the IOS port) and secondly entering it after the login as; username:xxx xxx does not work either. Connecting without the password gave no popup requesting it that I was expecting because of the missing field. Additionally _  opening the connection profile and clicking OK removes it from the favourites! (deleting it?). Poor experience.,1,02/24/2020,175

App884,org.videolan.vlc,Just downloaded the update _  and Still can not sort files by date added to folder. This is a basic requirement. Search engines show this very basic feature for vlc _  has been asked about for over five years. Not acceptable _  i had to comment Only reason i keep trying vlc app _  is it uses very little battery compared to the ravenous mx player. The three stars are for that sole reason. Vlc desktop program has been superb for me _  almost twenty yrs useage,3,12/29/2019,25
App884,org.videolan.vlc,VLC has since my last review returned to the outstanding media-player I know and love from my computer but in android.

Whatever it may be _  I hope the VLC team can get once more.YT stream support on VLC.,4,02/20/2020,62
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I've been using this as my media player of choice for years but a recent update has made the swipe to seek function difficult to use - resulting in unintended behaviour. For example _  swiping left near the right hand of the screen either seeks forward or pauses the video and vice versa. This worked flawlessly before what's happened?,4,03/04/2020,78
App884,org.videolan.vlc,VLC in all it's forms (I've had it on Windows _  Linux _  several phones) is awesome. Which is an understatement and a mere review can't really capture the magnitude of my gratefulnes to the developers for having this program _  and free aswell!! VLC is free (Availability) VLC supports different platforms (Cross platform) VLC doesn't need extra downloads to support any files you throw at it. It's actually fun to try and open random files with VLC _  even something like .mkv (Matroska video format) which I know PS3 struggled back in the day and some other programs need codecs for and also phones need extra programs for _  that often are either shady or no where up to speed. VLC is and will always be my choice for a video AND audio player (audio for PC at least). Most video players on Android just can't keep up!,5,03/01/2020,218
App884,org.videolan.vlc,New update has messed up everything _  it screwed up the experience that VLC is best media player. Last update is the worst thing from VLC.

Also _  it would be awesome if you provide a SHARPNESS and CONTRAST ENHANCE/ CHANGE option like in the PC version. 3.

If you implement this _  i will be your fan for life. That is why i give a 4 star Othewise good player with no ads...,4,02/07/2020,204
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Why in the ever loving **** would you give the option of deleting entire storage locations from within the app? I was trying to remove my internal storage from the directory so the app would not detect files from it (only the SD card) using the "delete" option _  only to find out that it literally deleted everything on the phone (media-wise). Poof--a thousand priceless photos gone.,3,03/04/2020,26
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Cant cast to a chromecast for longer than 10 minutes before it gets confused and tries to load something entirely different than what i was playing _  but really just freezes and stops casting.,1,03/16/2020,11
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Sometimes I'm scared to upgrade coz the upgrade's far worse than the previous but still a very amazing app. Been using this since about 2014 and I can say it's the best out there,4,03/26/2020,0

App884,org.videolan.vlc,Subtitle not showing up..,5,04/07/2020,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Decent _  but have usability problems: 1. the app force refresh the folder content at same time when user is selecting what he want _  that is very annoying and caus a lot of lag.,4,03/15/2020,3
App884,org.videolan.vlc,This app isn't perfect _  you'll experience a few bugs in new updates. But where it gets better is the support of the developers. Whenever a bug is reported _  an update will be already there fixing the problem. For this reason it deserves a 5 star rating.,5,12/27/2019,27
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Latest updates are great but when you take a look at 'PLAYit' _  then you know there is still a lot to improve about user experience.,5,03/11/2020,8
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Problem on having it to fit screen it just only zoomed the video. Can you fix this? I have some videos on sd and when i resize it to best fit or others except the fit screen it have a big border. Well on 720p it have no problem wheb just having it on center. JUST FIX THE FIT screen thats all that I asked before I uninstall and find other application.,3,02/06/2020,43
App884,org.videolan.vlc,The position of the subtitles should be independant of what the video size is . Like when i set the video to fit screen the subtitles go below the screen and only partially visible.. is there any option to change the position of the subtitles ? Cause if not maybe it would be a good thing.,4,01/02/2020,14
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Decent player but the Android Auto side of the app needs a lot of work. Biggest thing is that media rarely ever resumes when you launch the app in AA. This usually means I have to launch the app on the phone to resume playback. Really need to add resume button in AA like there is in the app.,4,01/31/2020,10

App884,org.videolan.vlc,Damn guys I don't know what you did bit I hope you can undo it _  mi vlc was working just fine _  now it doesn't shows all my videos _  can't sort them by size _  video suddenly stops to rescan libraries _  all kind of troubles it didn't had in the previous version. I hope you can fix it because this is still my choice of media player Edit. Still trash,2,02/04/2020,63
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Great program _  I have been having an issue with using the repeat feature. When I repeat 1 song it always seems to turn ab repeat on and starts from the point in the song that I actually turned on repeat. It is very irritating because I can't just repeat the song.,3,01/29/2020,7
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Great app but had to uninstall and rate lower. Will not stop autoplaying audio files when I get into my car. Annoying beyond belief and cannot find any settings to disable this behavior. Please assist and I will adjust my rating accordingly for this otherwise perfect app.,2,01/28/2020,13
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I only use it to cast content to my chromecast. But the cast button just disappeared after using it one time.

Using local cast for now and not vlc until they fix it,1,02/16/2020,18

App884,org.videolan.vlc,The "fix" stopped VLC from loading any videos on my android device. VLC says all directories are "empty". They are not. It was working good before the "fix". Now I have to search for the file I want to watch _  then select VLC to play it. Not good.,1,01/06/2020,35
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Definitely one of the BEST players on Mobile!! Android phones should come stock with this video player!!

App884,org.videolan.vlc,Plays in the background again _  sorry for being pissy. Would be not nice to have autoplay. Other than that _  good on ya.,5,03/06/2020,2

App884,org.videolan.vlc,This is one of the best media players I've ever used. It's done perfectly _  the codec is so optimized and videos play smooth as butter. I expected the Android port to be dumbed down but it isn't lacking too many features. Amazing work!,5,01/23/2020,23

App884,org.videolan.vlc,I use it to play voicemail files because it's the only app I know of that can play the files. One thing I absolutely HATE about it is that it takes over my Bluetooth media and it's like pulling teeth to get it to give control to my Google Play Music again.,2,03/02/2020,11

App884,org.videolan.vlc,Not liking the overhaul The new vlc has less options a worse ui No option for grid view Resume last playlist doesn't work Lost all previously saved playlists No sort by date or last played I am very disappointed with the (2nd to most recent) VLC update and that they have released an additional update without fixing this further disappoints me. Update: still not fixed down to 1 star,1,02/10/2020,97
App884,org.videolan.vlc,This is so goddamn worst app. You guys even can't do normal support of this app. Casting from this app really worst experience. Icon cast from time to time just despairing and you are not able to cast videos from your smartphone to TV. Thank you so much for showing which app it's better to not use.,1,01/04/2020,18

App884,org.videolan.vlc,Good app. Good to have Chromecast support. Bug when trying to add song to playlist  _  tapping on the three dots moves the scroll bar and the song to be added is list from screen view. Fix this bug please and I will bump up the review to 5 stars,4,01/03/2020,8
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Ever since the new update it's terrible. The new design looks bad. Sometimes tapping once _  when a video is play _  stops it other times it shows the controls. Whenever I add new videos it can't find them or mislabeles them until I restart the app.,1,01/06/2020,21
App884,org.videolan.vlc,After last update there is problem with resume of playing audio. I have an audiobook and when I pause it and try to resume it _  it starts from beggining. After that I must search where I pause it. But it is one of my favourite player.,3,01/09/2020,5

App884,org.videolan.vlc,Ok _  in regards to opening media content _  awesome. However _  the app doesn't resume play from where paused. Therefore everytime you stop you have to figure out where you were. Ugh _  frustrating if you listen while working or somewhere you have interruptions.,3,02/27/2020,6
App884,org.videolan.vlc,All types of audio and video formats can be played or edited here. Totally worth it! Useful for teaching and personal interests.,5,03/24/2020,5
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Upgraded my review to 4 stars now that Playlists have "Display in List". Audio: Still no "Seek Buttons" (as can be enabled in Video). It is especially in audio podcasts that this is needed for easily going back a few seconds. Will give 5 stars when this is enabled.,4,01/25/2020,32
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Great app: open source _  no ads _  and plays everything. However _  it should have the simple ability to rewind and fast forward by a set time (say 30 seconds). Using the slider is impossible to do this.,3,01/04/2020,8

App884,org.videolan.vlc,One of the best apps I have ever used; however last time I updated it _  the app stopped downloading subtitles. Please _  do fix this bug.,3,03/10/2020,79
App884,org.videolan.vlc,My main use for VlC is to cast my videos to my Chromecast. It is very buggy and frustrating to use. The main presentation of your videos is also very frustrating with some videos grouped into folders while others will be just lined up one after the other,2,01/03/2020,16
App884,org.videolan.vlc,When other apps fail to comprehend file formats? VLC works almost every time. Love it. Any chance of getting 3D side by side/top and bottom support or the ability to playback non 3d format files in VR headsets for phones _  though? That'd make VLC the PERFECT all-in-one media app!!,4,01/04/2020,9
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Absolutely the best app for playing videos as well as audio the sound output is quite good especially with the recent update only one glitch is that the app crashes once in a while for no reason hope the developer addresses this soon rather than later otherwise great job _  definitely 5 stars from me,5,01/13/2020,19

Android vlc not great as pc version,3,01/08/2020,13
App884,org.videolan.vlc,When casting you will either skip to the end or restart if you try to rewind. It's a bad experience. Even after pausing _  going to the bathroom _  then playing it restarts. Such a great computer app for a bad mobile app.,1,01/12/2020,12
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I can't fast forward the episodes I'm watching _  which makes it hard for me to skip some parts I don't want to watch. Thought it was my settings on my phone but I checked and everything is alright. Other than that it's a fairly good app.,2,01/23/2020,5

App884,org.videolan.vlc,It's an amazing media player! Here's a fun idea _  make VLC support 360 video with all the interaction intact _  that would be more amazing!,5,03/31/2020,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,The one thing missing from this app is the ability to sort files by modified date. I really think that this would make the app perfect. The rationale is a lot of times and you have new files you want them at the top because that's what you want to WATCH.,4,01/08/2020,10

App884,org.videolan.vlc,It is really annoying to change audio tracks and select subtitles on every single video separately. Another option for setting audio track and subtitle preference on Android should be there.,1,02/09/2020,2
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I have used VLC across many platforms for probably the last 19 years and while there are a few extra options I would like for audio playback _  I still recommend VLC exclusively to anyone that needs any type of media player.,5,02/17/2020,26

App884,org.videolan.vlc,Updates shouldn't remove functionality _  but they did. And wat were they thinking making longer filename's / tiles scroll? I can hardly read episode name or number anymore as one of them is constantly off screen. And ofc no setting to disable something like that.,1,02/13/2020,13
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Everything is good but they should imrove audio player interface. It cannot change track by audio player automatically I have to change it manuall So plzzz look after it.,4,03/09/2020,2

App884,org.videolan.vlc,Would love to give the app 5 stars but the lack of pinch to zoom is a major drawback considering that gesture has been around 10 or 15 years? I was quite shocked that such a well known and respected video player does not support it.,3,01/15/2020,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,This works well but there is no obvious way to save the address to an RTSP stream _  so you have to enter it in every time. Even keeping a history of the last 5 or 10 streams would be useful.,4,02/25/2020,3
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Ability to play videos not generaly suported by android seven stars. sneek permissions that acess cellular data that can also be used to spy on U. I give 3 stars for cyber security risk assesments because of sneek permission that acess cellular data permissions in background. newer versions of android os you can disable this in settings but you really have to look to find it & vlc was sort of sneeky as for all other permissions it lets you know whats its doing & asks but not background data.,4,03/01/2020,2

App884,org.videolan.vlc,Really unintuitive. Adding files to playlists is awful! You tap on the playlist name _  and it transfers the name down at the bottom as if to create a new playlist. And no indicator anything has happened. Terrible UI,2,02/04/2020,48

App884,org.videolan.vlc,It's strange 10+ years ago when I first used VLC on PC I never had problems playing videos. For some reason the app now has 5x more settings _  tweaks & customizations that's cool and all _  but now it has to "convert" my files [while its playing?] Which 75% of the time means my $300 samsung galaxy A10e doesnt have the memory or processor capability to maintain a stable conversion often when I'm not even using the phone watching the video casted to my tv... now I'm no dev. But I think it's now worse,4,05/13/2020,0

Just more sort options In general would make the experience much better imo.,4,05/07/2020,1

App884,org.videolan.vlc,VLC on pc has been going downhill for a decade now and the mobile version is no exception. Random glitches like videos playing as audio with the first-frame thumbnail as the video feed. Constantly losing its place in longer playlists. All these simple functions that VideoLAN used to excel at that have been suffocated by feature creep being crammed down its throat. Makes me wistful of the non-cell-shaded traffic cone icon of the early 2000s.,3,03/25/2020,0

App884,org.videolan.vlc,Easy to use and by far the best equalizer I've found for my music. It puts off a good mixture of bass and treble whereas other apps specifically created as equalizers are usually 1 sided. Lots of treble and no bass or vise versa. Not really equal at all.

App884,org.videolan.vlc,The app is awesome! Before writing this review _  I was asked to answer whether the app's description fits the actual app. And it completely does! It really is the best option out there if you want a music and video-player that is easy to handle _  as well as performant and offers very high compatibility. I tested the streaming and local network features and they worked flawlessly. About the setting I liked that it is possible to switch themes on the fly without restarting the app. In other apps that is necessary but here the process of choosing and comparing themes is much more user-friendly. What I would like to be added though is an option to set the size of the grid when you set your library view to grid mode. The ability to set tags and covers would be a nice addition too. I really like this app and the fact that it's COMPLETLY FREE,5,02/27/2020,0

App884,org.videolan.vlc,I love the vlc desktop app but I hate this Android app. Everytime I start the applications _  it searches for other media even after me disabling the option (This process last for 5-6 min).

App884,org.videolan.vlc,While I'm a fan of VLC _  you made a lot of "******" change in it and lots of videos and movies are out of sync.

It's no longer possible to sort videos by date or look up info about a video _  and it's not possible anymore either to delete anything from inside the app (this is useful how?!). Why can't you leave basic things like this alone? It's not even stated in the update notes _  so the user doesn't know until it's too late. This is why I've become very wary of updates; they are so often downgrades _  as _  unfortunately _  is this one. Uninstalled after many years of use.,2,12/12/2019,136

App884,org.videolan.vlc,I just need a player _  which resumes audio playing correctly and can modify playing speed. Is it too much to ask? Apparently yes _  for VLC.

App884,org.videolan.vlc,Playlist Organization Changes are Bizzare! I would like to revert back to previous version but can't. Which means the auto update system forces the user to use each and every new update. So specifically _  when you search for a video to add it to a playlist _  you have to scroll down each time just to enter the addition. The playlist now forces users to o view their playlist in thumbnail in mode. This takes up a lot of space forcing the user to see thumbnail images for each playlist name. More.,1,12/10/2019,27

App884,org.videolan.vlc,I have been using VLC for quite some time. Have to say that new UI looks better then past orange one. It just somehow feel cleaner. Some things need work. One such thing is video list. Default behavior is to group videos by name. On more then one video group tapping it open the group and we can see information from there. It group videos in a list of one video if there is no other video with same six first letters. Now I can't find a way to show information for that one video.,4,12/08/2019,73
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I was a big fan of this player _  ever since I was using it on my computer long before the Android devices and I would have given it the highest rating. However _  I made the mistake of running the app while on wifi and it upgraded itself from v. 2.5.13 to v. 3.2.3 without notice and despite my device's settings to ask before upgrading. Big mistake _  because it now is slow to launch and is sluggish! An automatic update should not have happened! The user should have been warned!,3,12/14/2019,86

App884,org.videolan.vlc,The latest update _  removed so many important features (like aspect ratio _  playback speed _  subtitles etc) that were available on the player _  now you have to press the 3 dots and then use these features. Bring those features back. Also _  the aspect ratio is not working properly _  I was watching a 1:1 video _  but aspect ratio was setting only to 16:9 _  4:3 18:9 etc. The "best fit" set to 16:9 _  when the video is 1:1. So fix the aspect ratio. Love VLC _  but these things have to be fixed.,1,12/15/2019,35
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I just loved this app _  it was perfect and could open almost every media file with it but it all ended with the last update... now it takes like an hour to load files and _  to make it worse _  now occupies an unjustified ammount of space in my phone memory _  slowing it down _  I think that a lot of us would like to fix this error because phone memory is sometimes... limited.,1,12/18/2019,495
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Latest update screwed everything up. For example if I switch to another app from VLC and then go back _  the font is set to small. This problem came with the latest update.

App884,org.videolan.vlc,BEST audio playing app to date! This gives me the best sound that even Google Music can't do with the long and accurate equalizer. I do hope they make the equalizer bigger both vertically and horizontally for it is so small on my screen. NOTE TO USERS!: When using high volume from VLC it will go off of the limit of your tablet's/phone's capability to send the sound out. The better the device _  the better the sound quality on songs at a loud volume.,5,12/12/2019,41

App884,org.videolan.vlc,This latest update really screwed things up. A lot of things didn't work with the last update and it's worst than the previous version. I was unable to connect through SMB to my computers anymore to play video files on my Android TV. But after some researching _  I found the way to resolve this is to install SMB1.0/CIFS File Sharing Support on my laptop on Turn Windows Features On/Off. However _  selecting subtitle file doesn't work as it asks to play the subtitle (.idx file) as audio file and selecting it stop the video playback. The group and sorting system on the previous version was much better than this latest update.,2,12/07/2019,429
App884,org.videolan.vlc,One of the best media player AND it is free (and FOSS) and without ads. The only problem I have is about advanced/complex ASS subtitles that don't animate correctly (e.g. in karaoke style fansubs in anime's OP/ED). Other than that it's great. "mpv" (also free/FOSS) has a better subtitle support but a much simpler/worse interface (with less features).,5,12/24/2019,0

App884,org.videolan.vlc,Latest update broke usability. VLC was my favorite app on my car’s android / gps system. It now can’t read folders properly _  grabbing incomplete directory results _  that randomly change on every load. Thumbnails no longer fully load. Extremely sluggish _  stalls for minutes.... My biggest pet peeve _  the solid white icon bg. For an app that claims to support dark mode _  nothing like a blinding white light on the dashboard (the VLC icon) while driving at night. Had to switch to MX Pro after this update.,2,12/17/2019,33
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Generally it works very well. But EVERY time there is a software update _  it forgets all my media _  and deletes all of my saved playlists. Which is extremely annoying as I have to create them from scratch every time. Doesn't seem to let you save the playlists anywhere separate from the live memory. So it is flawed.,3,12/18/2019,32
App884,org.videolan.vlc,This works with pretty much any media type and has loads of different options aswell _  I use it on all the devices I use media on and since my phone is always on me vlc for android and I have gotten to know each other quite well. The feature I wasn't expecting but loved was the pop up sized player _  it really helps to be able to actually use my phone/tablet while watching a movie or listening to music! Vlc on the pc was always installed on my computers when I was younger and now I get why.,5,12/19/2019,265

App884,org.videolan.vlc,The last update was THE worst I've ever seen in any app. Huge ugly icons for playlists _  user-unfriendly interface. After the update _  my playlists turned empty _  that's right _  like with 0 media files in them. The app is constantly refreshing to identify new media files _  yet it doesn't actually recognize any of my new mp3s. I would pay the devs to do humanity a favor and roll back the update!,1,12/30/2019,18

App884,org.videolan.vlc,Love this app in the terms of video format compatibility and playing quality and functions. _ BUT it is very disappointing that the file sorting method is limited to "by name" only _  if other ways such as"by date" _  or "by file type". Thus function has never ... never been added to any one of the updates.,4,12/16/2019,9
App884,org.videolan.vlc,This would easily be a five star app if not for the issues that have surfaced ever since the recent UI updates on most phones. Now it drops everytime the screen goes off.

Sad being this was my favorite for years! Would come back if yhey could resolve current problems.,2,12/16/2019,17
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Whatever happened with the lastest update has rendered this app unusable. Upon opening the app it immediately starts scanning me media and freezes permanently.

App884,org.videolan.vlc,This app has had really irritating problems for years _  and I cannot even figure a way they haven't have fixed if ANY of the developers are actually using it. Sometimes videos will loop back to a certain point in the video when they're finished without the ab loop being turned on in any perceivable way. Sometimes it won't auto play the next item on a list. Sometimes it will always play a media from a certain point when starting it - yet it DOESNT properly save the last play location upon leaving,2,12/20/2019,55

App884,org.videolan.vlc,Well _  everyone is right. This latest update sucks. Used it after the update and it only loaded 1 of the 20 albums I currently have on my phone and it wouldn't scan my directories to find them.

App884,org.videolan.vlc,Was great before the last update. Now the video files are all jumbled. When you click on one _  another different one opens. Some you can delete. Some you cannot. Video files are duplicated. Was perfect before. Why could you not just leave it alone ...,1,12/08/2019,27
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Latest update kinda sucks _  I can't double tap to play/pause the video anymore _  I don't see the option for it in settings either. I liked the orange background color to the icons on the video player interface better. The new UI seems a little bit smoother but i ain't really digging it.,3,12/11/2019,7
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Local network (smb) worked beautifully on 3.1.7. Updated to 3.2.3 and the app just gets stuck on loading screen when trying to access local network. Thank goodness for apkmirror so i can revert back. Remind me to NEVER update vlc ever. Old saying is true _  if it ain't broke don't update it.,1,12/16/2019,7

App884,org.videolan.vlc,Weird glitch Downloaded this for five minutes and then uninstalled because it's playing 2second voice clips while I'm in other apps?

App884,org.videolan.vlc,It'll play anything you throw at it _  but the management of files and playlists (and the UI in general) is total trash. It's strangely buggy _  as though the developers don't even use their own stuff (they probably don't; they probably use a command-line interface or something).,2,12/22/2019,6
App884,org.videolan.vlc,By far the best media player. Always used on laptop and android. Plays soo many formats. Just brilliant. One downside I had with the last update on my phone was that the list of playlists are now icons and I can't get them back to a normal text-list. Can't find the setting for that anywhere.,5,12/26/2019,23

App884,org.videolan.vlc,Unreliable. Audio does not work while Chromecasting half the time and randomly stops playing the file throughout. I have reinstalled this app several times hoping it has been updated but problem has been persistent for over 6 months. It also seems to leave something saved in your hardware without your permission as somehow the files resume where they've left off even after uninstalling and reinstalling.,1,01/18/2020,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,It only shows videos from A - S _  but I'm sure I have videos that go well past the letter S. It has to be a glitch of some sorts because whenever I want to see any video files that start with any letter past A - S _  I would have to temporarily exit it _  then immediately return to it _  and the video files would eventually show up...,2,12/10/2019,26
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Preferred the older version _  can't download subtitles without crashing _  menu (play _  pause _  subtitles _  next _  prev etc.) opens very slowly on 1 tap _  pressing anything soon after doesn't register at all. You have to wait a bit press it so it can register. 1 star just to get attention for fixes.,1,12/25/2019,10

App884,org.videolan.vlc,People _  this app works _  its great and wow _  its VLC. I'll copy/paste my movies/songs straight to my phone and it works _  no worries. If you've used VLC on PC you'll know what to expect. But yes this is legit _  and after having this for over 2 years (on this p.o.s old android) now i can confirm i haven't had a single problem with it. If you're using a default media player _  do yourself a favour and start using this. 10/10,5,12/10/2019,144
App884,org.videolan.vlc,The newest update is just... awful. Parsing media now freezes midway _  and a lot of the videos on streaming no longer work. Not to mention the fact that it takes up way too much room. I can't recommend this anymore because of these issues,1,12/23/2019,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,It is a great app in most cases but when it comes to casting mkv files atleast _  it takes 100 tries before finally displaying "this file requires conversion.." etc. then FINALLY it works _  hopefully in the future it will get it right the first time so casting can be a solid option.,3,01/16/2020,0

App884,org.videolan.vlc,This has to be one of the best video players we have today. If I could give a score of a 4.5 _  I would. The only reason I am not giving 10/10 is due to the fact that it does not support multi-tasking very well. I would like it to minimize to a small window when I hit the Home button to allow me to do something else.,4,12/25/2019,2

App884,org.videolan.vlc,Loved it. Very functional and met all my expectations for a music/video player--that is _  until the latest update. App lags _  esp during playback. Can't sort list by last added files. Everything was great before.,4,12/17/2019,0

App884,org.videolan.vlc,There is no option to EXPORT a (streaming) created playlist as a m3u file so i can share it with others. Possible on PC version but isn't possible on mobile version. Sucks!

App884,org.videolan.vlc,Forced app. If you uninstall it will keep trying to update itself. I find that rude and and invasion of my app space.

App884,org.videolan.vlc,Pretty awesome media player _  except for a few REALLY ANNOYING bugs. Most importantly _  I can't switch to landscape mode from portrait without triggering PiP  _  and when I enlarge the PiP view _  either the video goes back to the beginning _  or the app crashes multiple times. Also _  I would like customizations for what can be used in the lock mode _  and what cannot. It would also be great if we could give a command to automatically stop playing after the current song ends _  while still listening to it (I don't wanna go to the Playlist and then delete stuff and all that). Also _  two other things that would be appreciated would be ability to custom-group media _  and support for Google assistant. Do this and you have 5 stars from me. But fix the rotation bug first!,3,10/17/2018,5
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I have been using it for years _  it's awesome. However Since some week _  there's a bug. My new media (audio) are not scanned properly. Even if I try to rescan the folder _  it is not able to get the media. I have to reinstall the app and then I can get the new media. Please fix this issue and I will rate it 5 stars P.S. - I have a Redmi Note 4 phone,4,04/03/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,SECOND UPDATE : To be fair _  1080p playback seems to work after restarting the phone _  but sorting of media by " recently added" works only in individual folders _  NOT on the main media list. Sleep timer seems to also work correctly again :-)) Thank you.,4,12/07/2019,28

App884,org.videolan.vlc,I love VLC . I really do. However we got this new bug where the app crashes EVERYTIME I TRY TO DOWNLOAD A SUBTITLE and it annoys me because this feature is what made me love vlc for android even more when I first installed it anf now it's not working. 😭,3,12/15/2019,6
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I really enjoy this media player because it looks and sounds as good as any of the other ones I've seen if not better than most. The best parts about this player is the controls and how many types of file it can play.,3,12/28/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,This was a very good app until the recent upgrade. Sadly it no longer plays when sharing from YouTube. I've uninstalled and reinstalled but still no joy. I'm on Android 9 and totally up to date. 5 stars when it worked.,1,12/19/2019,6

App884,org.videolan.vlc,A nice _  fully featured music and video player with a good equalizer and decent playback controls. Such a shame that it doesn't cope well with large amounts of music. I have about 6 _ 000 files in total _  and the app just simply doesn't detect them after a certain point _  forcing me to use a more reliable app with less features _  blackplayer. And yes _  this happens across multiple devices I own.,2,04/02/2019,2
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I've been using vlc for so long.. so i'm very used to it.. but recently i changed my phone and could not upload an applicaton of it because of its big mb.. so i dont have a choice but to download another app.. and i was not happy and comfortable using the other applications.. vlc is still the best..,5,12/29/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I have used VLC on several computers for years and am quite happy with that application. However _  on my android (version 9) phone _  the player frequently begins to play a file without even me opeing the file. Additionally _  there is no way to shut it off without restarting the phone. Yet _  even then _  after 5 or 10 minutes _  it will start playing again without me opening the program. I finally deleted the program from my phone to search for another until it is corrected.,3,04/30/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,The widget does not work. Period. First off. You can use it to open the app when pressing the vlc logo but playback buttons non functional. Also it doesn't save your place or even what item you are playing in the widget. So you have to go back to the app find what you were playing and manually select it every time. It saves place on individual tracks but you need to press play on the album and skip forward to the track you want every time otherwise it will play one track and stop. This is very simple stuff that needs to be fixed ASAP. Not recommended. Unfortunate because VLC has been my go to for years on the computer.,2,10/09/2018,18
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Overall great _  but:  1) It would be good if it was possible to change the playback speed while watching a video with a gesture (changing the brightness and volume is already possible). 2) It would be good if the 'three vertical dots' settings (while playing a video) were more informative (why do the "rectangle with vertical bar" and the "round arrow with dots underneath" do what they do?). There is enough space there to provide a short description in text.,3,12/31/2018,2

App884,org.videolan.vlc,I'm not sure why all of the sudden playing music is not that good anymore. Whenever I click a certain song _  it does not play. Also when playing videos on my playlist _  video will stop after it end and doesn't play the next video. I think this started after my update. Hope you'll find a fix for this. Been playing music in Google Play now.,2,10/30/2018,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,As far as apps go _  this is the most fit for purpose media player. The UI and features are so intuitive and well thought out that I can't recommend it enough. On more than one occasion I've thought "I wonder if I can ... with VLC" and not only is the feature where I expect to find it _  it has extra goodies I have never seen before. Like fast forwarding through a video by dragging anywhere left to right _  or adjusting volume by dragging up or down _  I wish Youtube would copy that control scheme.,5,04/15/2019,3
App884,org.videolan.vlc,VLC is a popular app for viewing videos and its great they do it for free with no ads _  keep it up. But then the app is inconsistent. It takes time to load videos _  lag at times and options are limited like choosing online subtitles. The interface looks polished and modern but does not behave like that. The names of the videos stored in my phone are displayed differently. Volume controls dont work well while watching videos. Overall an app which should be good is marred with many little problems which give a bad user experience. I request the developers to please look into these issues and make the app work great on all devices without incomplete features and using less resources. Looking forward for quick fixes in the following updates.,3,10/16/2018,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,it's not much _  it's not a great app. The only advantage i have seen that it can support any formats of videos. But the Auto scan thing is hateful. it's taking so much time for scanning. it's a great lagg to the app. The subtitle we download can't take it as a file. it will be only encoded with the video _  we can't see the subtitles files .I recommend mxplayer. it's a great app. have a good collection of subtitles etc . it's far more better than this,1,06/04/2019,2

App884,org.videolan.vlc,I've been using this on android for almost a couple years and have finally given up on it. The dealbreaker is the sound is too quiet. At max volume in a quiet room I sometimes still can't understand what characters are saying. The 200% volume setting does nothing on my tablet. Volume booster apps stopped working with vlc. Other apps are loud and clear.   Another very annoying bit is the app gives priority to a file's Title tag _  not the file name itself _  and to change a Title tag on an mkv file requires spending a couple minutes per video stripping the tag on the computer. It's doable _  but a very irritating hassle.   I've switched over to mx player and neither of these things are issues. Mx player is really very great for me so far.,2,11/05/2018,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I had an old Samsung who's music app would instantly play the last played song when I got back in my van and it connected to Bluetooth. This app doesn't do that unless it's only been a short time that I've been away. A lot of my music has also been placed in one folder. I have Greendays greatest hits; in that album as well are red hot chilli peppers _  GnR's and Lenny Kravitz to name a few. The same is the case when I go in a specific bands greatest hits album _  all artists greatest hits are there.,3,03/27/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,When I stop an audio file (like a 13 hour audiobook) _  it will not start where it stopped. Instead _  it starts back at the beginning. Meaning I have to remember the exact time I left off and then manually drag the bar to the right time. So inconvenient. There is also no forward/backward 10 or 30 control buttons.,2,10/11/2018,4
App884,org.videolan.vlc,It is a great app and I use it many years on multiple devices. Recently I have installed on my android based smart tv. Everything works fine _  I can even access my files through my home network directly from my PC. One small problem which I have encountered only.. while I can access the video file from my computer _  the same does not apply to the subtitles (.srt) files. It is a shame though _  because of this I am forced to watch the movie from USB. Please fix this problem. Beside this no complain _  t hank you for the great app!,4,11/25/2018,16
App884,org.videolan.vlc,The app is working fine. However _  it will be helpful if you add double tap to skip 10 seconds ahead for audio files. I mostly use the app to listen to 4-5 hour lecture recording and it would be helpful if I'd be able to return back 10 seconds just by double clicking instead of dragging the bar (which definitely needs to be improved as well). Thank you.,3,03/30/2019,2
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Could be a great app but there are a few glaring (and very important) issues. First _  you cannot rename artists/albums/songs. They go by meta-data _  which is incorrect in nearly all situations. Second _  it seems to be crash prone _  with no apparent reasons I can pinpoint or replicate. Third (and most important to me) is playback is wrong in the begining of songs. Either the first 10th to half second of the track gets skipped past _  or it gets "moved" forward (i.e. the first 10th to half second plays on top of what should be that amount of time later).,3,10/03/2018,2
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I used to love this app but now it frustrates me. Whenever I rotate my screen the video that I'm watching will jump back to the beginning. If the video was part of a playlist it will not continue to go through the playlist after rotating the screen. I emailed the developers haven't heard anything back yet hopefully they release a fix soon.,2,10/12/2018,4

App884,org.videolan.vlc,VLC is the premier audio/video app for mobile. Update 3.1.1 however was a huge misstep. The app functionally no longer works reliably. The auto-parse feature only seems to find the files it's in the mood to find _  playlists are hopelessly broken _  etc. I have been forced to revert to an older version. Always a last resort and never a good option. Please repair this iconic application so we can all get on with our lives. Nothing else compares to a working version. :(,5,04/29/2019,3
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Gets stuck in Android Auto when playing a playlist which contains video as audio songs (actually it's not even a video just m4a container) which is really annoying and potentially dangerous when playing a playlist during driving _  bc it doesn't respond. It also randomly deleted my playlists,1,12/10/2019,7
App884,org.videolan.vlc,One of the clunkiest _  slowest _  most unusable video players on the platform. It's totally fine for a completely free app _  but there are way too many better alternatives out there.,1,01/29/2020,0

App884,org.videolan.vlc,Beautiful Performance App .,5,05/25/2020,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,The player is constantly rescanning my library. I have 90GB of music on an SD card. Every other time I start the app it spends a ridiculous amount of time first re-scanning my library _  and then re-parsing the media even though nothing has changed. m3u file support is spotty at best: it shows that my m3u files have songs in them _  but when I try to open one the app just sits there scratching its butt with a "0:00" song on the screen and eventually crashes. The m3u files are all added to the "Playlists" page _  but if I try to view a playlist it just shows as empty.  I think maybe the #extinf tags aren't handled correctly (or simply ignored _  as any self-labeled software developer with credentials from the bottom of a box of Cracker Jacks would do when optional media tags "aren't understood").  Aside from that _  the FLAC files play just fine! But I'm really looking for something with decent playlist support.,2,11/21/2018,4
App884,org.videolan.vlc,It is surely a good media player _  but I've found several issues lately that impact the way I use the app. Firstly I prefer landscape and it sometimes switches to portrait and refuses to go back unless I frantically shake my device (Note 9) for a while. Secondly it consistently stops playing after skipping through network streamed video a number of times. For example _  skip forward _  skip forward _  video stream has frozen _  restart app. I'm not talking about network buffering.,3,02/16/2019,2
App884,org.videolan.vlc,pretty cool _  quite friendly interface and no problems with most formats. My issues are: (1) everytime I pause and play a video _  the sound cuts off for a 2-3 seconds and then there's an annoying clicking sound which is quite loud - not happening on any other devices. (2) unconvenient playlist set up _  no option to save the queue as a playlist or add whole folders to the play queue; could have more easy acces to multiple sound tracks if available; please add some options for soft coded subs - size!,3,02/01/2019,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,This is the ONLY media player that can find and play all of my WMA files! Even the Android file system doesn't recognize some of the WMA files that I transferred _  but this player finds them all and can play them all! Like the Windows app _  the Android version is amazing. And no ads! (so far :) )  The only small gotcha is that the refresh doesn't seem to always work. I deleted a file on my Pixel 2 _  hit refresh in VLC _  and it still appeared. Not a big deal as I'm so thrilled that I can now play ALL of my music.,5,03/16/2019,8
App884,org.videolan.vlc,It has limited support for playback _  unlike on Windows and Mac machines _  on Android _  this player is lacking. I specifically have troubles playing files from FTP with this player _  it's not just slow _  it just downright doesn't work 99% of the time. This player has 0 fighting chance in this department. Otherwise a decent player. +1 star for being free with no ads.,4,03/21/2019,0

An option to manually parse files would be nice to fix this issue.,4,03/31/2019,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I loved this app for listening to audio books as it saved and replayed from where you left off.

App884,org.videolan.vlc,VLC's signature traffic cone logo is probably one of the best known logos in America. (unverified statistic) There's a reason for it: VLC is hands down the best media player there is available. Multi-platform _  multi-purpose _  no ads _  no IAP. Donating is optional _  and no features are locked behind bars _  all open-source. This is why VLC is the best media player out there. Get it. You won't regret it. Plus _  there's dark theme! Note: This review wasn't paid for. I just truly love VLC that much.,5,12/31/2018,13
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I use this mainly for listening to audio books _  works fine as is _  but I would give it 5 stars if there was an option to go back 30 or so seconds _  instead of restarting the entire track over.

App884,org.videolan.vlc,I have used VLC for years both mobile and on my PC.

App884,org.videolan.vlc,Would have rated it a 5 B4 I listened to an audiobook I downloaded on it. There is a lot to be desired as far as listening to audiobooks goes.

App884,org.videolan.vlc,When you have an absolutely massive collection of music like I do _  it often takes forever for the library to be rebuilt or added to; oftentimes _  music that was there before doesn't show up _  while other tracks end up getting duplicates. Searching by artists restricts to album data rather than individual artist credits (which is fine for some things like movie soundtracks _  but detrimental for things like downloads from Overclocked ReMix _  which credits the album artist to the entire website) Otherwise _  the app plays music. It does videos _  too. But the gaps start to show once you get a bigger collection.,3,12/12/2018,6
App884,org.videolan.vlc,worked great for years _  but now almost every song I download doesn't appear in VLC even after downloading it multiple times _  so I installed a different music player app what what do you know _  multiple copies of every song I downloaded was in there _  my downloads never failed only VLC did _  I'll still check regularly to see if the problem has-been fixed because I love this app and I've been using it for years _  but for now I'm going to have to use something different until you fix your bugs,3,05/05/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I am using this application for a couple of month _  infact there is no parallel. Intuitive user interface and diverse / flexible functionalities both for audio & video files.   As part of continuous improvement _   here is some feedback.  1. The play list feature is currently available only in audio section. (The play list options for local / online media should be save able and exportable for both audio and video files. (There should be a seperate section where we can access play lists. An option like save current play list may please be added.  2. CRITICAL ONE: With mixed audio / vidoe tracks in playlist _  when running some tracks in audio _  and the next track is video track _  instead of playing the video track as audio or unlocking the screen thus playing video _  the playback stops.  :-| 3. Sometimes it gives _  can not read media file from SD card error but its ok as I restart. 4. Future development: Scheduled playback. (Start/Stop running this media / play list 9:00 pm dated. to help those who use tracks while sleeping)  5. Video Tutorial with every update"How to use all features of VLC version --".  Once again _  this app is excellent.  I love it and use it on daily basis.  Thanks!!,5,01/01/2019,14
App884,org.videolan.vlc,It's a good media player _  like really good. BUT The mobile app is garbage! Vital functions are missing! For Audio: No way create playlist from playlist tab _  you have to click the three dots on the audio file and select "add to playlist". This is the ONLY way to create a playlist. No way to edit playlists. Once you've finally figured out this app's goofy way of creating an audio playlist _  there's no way to edit it. Your only (useful) option in the playlist tab is the ability to delete an already existing playlist. For Video: There's absolutely NO WAY to create a playlist AT ALL! You can click the three dots on the video file and select "play as audio" _  and for some reason that adds it to a playlist _  but you can't add multiple video files to a playlist using this method. So if you want to create different playlists for your videos _  use Power Media instead. For some reason _  the morons behind developing the VLC mobile app thought it would be a bright idea to exclude the ability to create video playlists from the mobile app. Don't bother with this app.,1,11/17/2018,28
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Cannot find new songs or videos _  when opening directly from file manager _  some songs play as a file with random numerical title. If a song resumes where you last left off _  it will loop on repeat 1 to the spot it resumed from _  not the beginning. Will eventually completely die after a couple weeks: library freezes _  infinitely searching for songs. Have had to reset app and clear data over 10 times to fix issues. I've had enough.,1,04/11/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Randomly _  songs will disappear from playlists and occasionally will not show up in the app at all. The only redeeming qualities to VLC are 1) VLC plays .wma files _  which I ignorantly created _  and 2) VLC is simpler to use than the other player I've tried. The .wma factor is the only reason I've reinstalled VLC player _  as that's easier than reripping all my CD's. If the playlist bug were fixed _  I might keep using VLC.,3,03/25/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Reading all these reviews stopped me from updating the app. I would suggest the negative comments to be taken into account. The VLC player is great and sometimes it's just good to leave it as it is without major updates. As it is said 'Less is more'. Spares one time for fixing and people are satisfied with the original. 🙂 Five stars for the old version,5,04/09/2019,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Delete function is not working. Whenever I'm deleting a song _  it will say "File deleted" but after 2 or 3 seconds _  the words "Failed to delete media" will appear _  and the title of the (deleted) song will be in the list again. Even the songs I've already deleted in my files are still in the list of songs of this app. Also _  new downloaded songs are not appearing. I used the search button cos it's supposed to search in all media files but it didn't work too. Please fix it. It's a bit annoying.,2,02/14/2019,7
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Good all-round media player. Earlier versions used to forget the indexing of my large muic library and had to reload at startup. That is no longer the case and all my media is available right away though not organized flawlessly. All video formats are supported _  including MKV which some players do not. Could use streaming to Miracast. Chromecast isn't the only casting protocol out there _  VLC team.,4,04/17/2019,8
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Auto starts and plays music _  as soon as Bluetooth connection is sensed _  including stepping into vehicle. ANNOYING. No option to disable behavior.,1,04/25/2020,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Does what it says it does _  but it could definitely be a bit better. The main focus behind the app seems to be video media _  given the massive number of codecs and file types it is able to read from _  but I feel that as an audio player it is lacking basic functionality that most other music apps have by default. Amongst other things it doesn't provide over-Bluetooth playlist information for cars and similar Bluetooth devices to use.,3,09/13/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,The new update is horrible. The app is buggy and slow. Crashes when going back to the list. Give us back the old version. Text me for a link to download the old version,1,12/07/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Can't skip forward. Whenever i try to double tap and skip forward or backward it just winds back to the part of the video where i want to skip from ! This started happening in the new update.,2,12/10/2019,6
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Audio Randomly pausing I need some troubleshooting help. Sometimes I switch to other apps while listening to an audio and often times the audio pauses without any reason _  please help. Apart from this the app excells at everything.,1,12/16/2019,11
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Loved VLC until last update. I only use for music _  but since last update _  the app no longer sees my music. I uninstalled VLC and installed again. NOW everything is fine except my Playlists are gone!,4,12/15/2019,2
App884,org.videolan.vlc,The app is awesome no doubt. But there's a problem with downloading the subtitles sometimes it does download and sometimes it doesn't. Pls check and fix it.,3,12/29/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,You really missed the mark on the last update. No grid view _  interface is terrible _  cant delete certain files! On the list view _  why does the "play all" arrow have to be there all the time!,1,12/20/2019,1

App884,org.videolan.vlc,worked at first on my pixel 3 XL. but then it started to run in the background and cut my internet speed and general speed of my phone by 3/4s causing issues with youtube videos and even simple web browsing. this is a huge issue and im not impressed. I almost returned my phone because it got so bad I thought there was an issue with my phone. would be one star but it did play a couple files that wouldn't play on my native phone platform.,2,03/24/2019,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Really good player that can play pretty much everything _  when it wants to... For me _  also crashes within a day of usage _  and subsequently fails to start at all. I can get the player to work again by deleting app data and cache _  but I don't feel like doing this twice a day. Worth 5 stars when it works _  but only 1 star right now.,1,01/21/2019,17
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I like your app a lot it has wonderful features that I didn't see in other apps . nothing is perfect .. your app has some issues such as when I turn off the auto rotation in my mobile the app still rotate the video I got over it by the lock feature but in my opinion it must be a choice . some times when I run a video the app just load and not start the video so I close it and start again the video and it plays it's not that annoying but it's a thing the thing that most annoyed me is that the app loses the point I stopped in the video sometimes so I have to re watch some clips to know where I stopped. thank you for your hard work and keep going I will still use the app and I hope that you fix the things that I mentioned earlier .,4,10/18/2018,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,It's pretty good for offline video and audio player. But _  the stream feature doesn't work. I couldn't stream youtube videos. Would you guys fix this asap please? it would be a 5 if it works. And would you kindly reply to me wether it's only my issue or it is a problem for everyone else and if so _  do you guys have any plan to fix it any time soon? I would wait for the fix if you guys are going to fix it.,3,03/21/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Nice! i had a video which didn't support eac3 audio _  i tried to install many apps such as MX player and also installed ARMV 7 Neon... i expected the audio will play without any problems _  but it went all opposite...after trying Google it nothing changed...after all i was very disappointed... Then i remembered VLC i loved to play videos _  movies in my PC with it... now okay let's try this also...i installed it and unfortunately it played the audio!!☺️ very proud user. VLC has retained it's belief.,5,02/12/2019,3
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I love VLC media player and have always used it windows _  linus _  and android over every other media player softwares. I can only say keep up the good work. Right now _  I have a bit of trouble with the new update. With the update _  there is a new option for playing only the audio in a video file. I couldn't get the video to play on repeat. The file just ends after playing once. Please respond and let me know what to do.,4,04/09/2019,6
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I want two more feature in VLC and that is to adjust subtitle size by percentage also (not just big _  small type) and let us adjust how to display the name of video in the app. I downloaded a video from a website and its name was showing as 'Netfilx' but it was not its original name. I guess is was reading from the title. There should be option to view them like according to folder name.,5,03/27/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,The 'repeat' option doesn't have the option to loop over all the videos in a directory. Only the option to loop one video is there or no repeat. While selecting a directory and playing it _  it does start the last played video _  a much older played video is resumed. Also add an option to pause playback when screen is touched while video is playing.,1,01/22/2019,2
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I love this video player _  so nice and easy yo use!! You can stream to Chromecast without using mirroring _  also the fact I can pick a few videos & only play the sound from them. Which is great at work & driving in my truck. Hands down _  a must have app. *Once in a while (maybe once every other month _  if that) it does freeze or get stuck on the loading screen. But closing & restarting is all thats needed to correct the issue.,5,03/30/2019,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Well the app works good if it opens up. But opening it up seems to be a big issue for me. Almost 90% of the time _  I'm not able to open VLC by clicking on a video file through a file browser. It just crashes. No error message or anything _  so yeah I don't have anything more to help you figure out the issue. By the way _  I'm on Android P _  if that helps.,3,01/10/2019,3
App884,org.videolan.vlc,This is the most versatile and well known media player in existence. Cross platform. No BS. My only complaint is that rescanning my media is hit and miss. Sometimes it works _  sometimes it takes 2 or 3 long scans _  and sometimes it's so stubborn that I have to delete all app data and settings _  reconfigure _  and only then does it find my new files. Autoscan never works. No matter what scanning is always slow.,4,06/21/2019,159
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I am rating this only for its music player. After last trying this app a year ago _  I decided to see if it had been improved by updates. I was initially impressed by how the UI looked _  but like before _  the lack of customization and some odd design choices mean most people will probably want to look elsewhere for a music player. First of all _  when you select a song/artist/album _  it does not play in shuffle mode - in fact _  there is not even an option to enable shuffle mode once the music starts playing! I have never come across a player with this restrictive behaviour before. You're also stuck with VLC's orange for the theme _  but that's not a big deal. Hope the community improves this.,2,05/27/2019,3
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I am using version 3.0.13. I refused to upgrade to the current APP because it wants permissions I find unacceptable. The app is perfect just the way it is in my current version. What does the upgrade need with a foreground service? And why does it need access to record audio? It is a five star app just the way it is now.,3,06/27/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Audio and video out of sync. Definitely not the video itself as it is done with all other players. VLC does have an audio delay function _  but it only works in 50ms increments _  so you can never get the AV to sync up. The rest of the app is nice _  but a video player that can't even keep it's AV in sync isn't very useful. Downloaded MX player instead. Much happier.,2,08/11/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Great work guys. You have my support with this. Here are a few things you should consider to improve experience of the user and the quality of the app. Firstly _  add the duration and current play time of the media file being played in audio mode on the notification drop down of smartphones. Secondly _  I should be able to put in audio mode and still have it playing as video and then switch to audio only if I use my power button. Thank you so much.,4,08/27/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Words cannot describe just how powerful this player is; with it _  I can do almost anything I want. The best part I like about it is the option to add my own subtitles,5,12/10/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Subtitle downloading feature is awesome. Really smooth video and audio player and lots of useful features like slow-mo and slide gesture to control brightness and volume.,5,01/28/2020,2

App884,org.videolan.vlc,Please add a way to always repeat/loop vids until i disable it _  in the settings _  like a toggle. Otherwise greaat software always loved and used vlc for years on the desktop version too and still love it _  just a slight minor nuisance.,3,02/22/2020,0

App884,org.videolan.vlc,the two problems I've been facing is that if you pause and audio and use some other app nd when you re-open VLC _  the audio you paused is just stopped. and you habe to replay nd find the spot you paused it at. Basically you pause the audio and VLC just disappears from notification bar. The second issue is that if you delete any audio _  often times it fails to delete. You can't delete it _  it remains there but you can't play it either.,3,03/26/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,It was awesome since I renamed the songs in my phone storage. I tried refreshing and uninstalling the app to vanish the songs which became double after rename in VLC. I'm really upset and disappointed because I haven't tried any other music app once I install it for the very first time. So fix it. I don't want to install any other app. I want only VLC. Thank you.,4,08/26/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Love VLC for PC _  so had to have on my tablet. It worked great until tonight _  when for no reason I could discover _  it started to freeze the video _  but not the sound _  when trying to navigate by the progress bar. It steps from chapter to chapter fine _  but trying to move within the chapter the screen freezes but audio continues. So I uninstalled _  then reinstalled _  hoping that would fix the problem. It didn't. I also tried a different movie. Same issue. Please fix.,2,02/19/2019,35
App884,org.videolan.vlc,This should be 5 stars but unfortunately this app does not group videos in it's folders. It's really hard for me to find the video I want to play since I have many videos in storage. And whenever I sorted out the videos say for example _  by date.. the next time I use the app.. it goes back to its mess up order. Can you do something about this? I on the verge of uninstalling this app,2,03/22/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,App is terrible _  after opening and pressing play one has to tap it at least 30 times before it finally plays. No help from VLC techs in fixing issue for the past 3 years.,1,12/10/2019,5
App884,org.videolan.vlc,You have NOTHING to lose trying this app!!!! I use VLC on every device in our home _  Cell phones _  tablets and computers. THAT'S 10 DEVICES IN TOTAL AND HAVE ZERO COMPLAINTS! My boys were 4 and 6 years old and could operate it on their tablets watching movies and changing settings by themselves. Don't EVEN get me started about the Windows version I use! I've tried everything I could find for media players and there has been NOTHING EVEN close to VLC!,5,03/22/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Used to be the best. Now cannot even do the most basic things a media player should do. Stops playback of mp3s after about a minute _  and randomly stops playing video after a few minutes. At least with video _  you can quickly change orientation and playback resumes for a while - until the next freeze. Never used to have these issues _  and I don't know why things have gotten so bad - but it is a shame _  and it is making me look elsewhere.,2,05/16/2019,89
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I use this app primarily for listening to Ogg Vorbis encoded audiobook CDs from the library. It really frustrates me that the player can't keep queue state between sessions. For example _  if I only listen to 8 of 14 tracks in my queue _  the next time I pull up the app _  I have to rebuild the queue _  and figure out myself where I left off. It gets old quickly.,2,03/08/2019,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Great app _  but since the last update _  it seems that app scan is not working anymore. I have added a few new videos _  but it does not appear in my video list as with previous versions. Also does not group videos anymore I cannot understand why people knocks down one of the best apps you can find - and it is also free. Just report issues - these guys always fix the bugs and or issues. Try to get Microsoft and or Apple to fix an issue and see how far you get.,4,04/21/2019,172
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Although the app is a well-made app overall. It has glaring flaws that make it unusable. At random points it will develop a flaw which makes it start the music file or video file in the middle of the song or video. The only way to fix this is to completely clear the memory of the application. The frequency that this happens is increasing.,1,12/03/2019,5
App884,org.videolan.vlc,It is an amazing app no doubt but this new update is really screwing with me i went on vlc this morning and all of my music was deleted all my playlists were empty and all that was left was my downloaded files If you have any help please respond back to me and hopefully the creators of vlc see this and help,1,12/11/2019,4

App884,org.videolan.vlc,This video app is exceptionally good _  it really works well...i love it and if you download it you're gonna love it too..kudos,5,05/20/2020,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Look _  its been over a year. You folks still wont fix the issues. Videos close them selves out. Audio the same. Why wont VLC fix issues? I think competitor's care more. It's funny I'd be willing to pay money for a pro version if these problems went away but it's like you guys are just *ssholes and don't give uh *hit. I used to think VLC was cool. I'd always tell my friends about it when I had it on PC over the many years but you folks really just don't care. I think I'll switch services. Bye.,1,03/01/2019,77
App884,org.videolan.vlc,My experience was poor what in the world is with the hieroglyphs in the options menu while playing video rather than words? are we catering to the illiterate now? also _  each time device is rotated it kicks you out of video? Preposterous! sound Equalization is terrible and very tricky to even get subpar or watchable. only Pro I can speak of is proper codex included from install oh _  that's it. not impressed overall,2,04/03/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,This is probably the best Video Player you can use now. I've had lot of issues with other popular video players regarding the ads. VLC provides minimal ads for the best user experience and a lot of customizations. The only problem I had is the grouping of the videos. You can group it alphabetically but we all need it to be grouped by the folder it's in _  which seems to be the only thing thats missing here.,5,01/20/2019,80
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I'be always loved VLC on my PC. But as of last night _  it's a complete FAIL as an app. EVERY single one of my music playlists is now EMPTY! After VLC parsed FOUR times in a row _  all the podcast _  video _  "radio plays" and audio books are intact but EVERY playlist that was music is EMPTY. And given that when I empty a playlist VLC automatically deletes a playlist...why are my music playlists empty but are still listed as playlists? OVER 400 songs removed from they're playlists. Back to MediaMonkey!,1,02/14/2019,2
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I like the apps design but it has issues. i have created 9 playlists and spent considerable time doing so then i go in today to find that they are all gone _  empty deleted. when i try to delete songs from my file that are duplicate songs they dont delete _  the file and song still shows up in the listing _  yet if i select them it says they can't be found. every single time i start VLC up it says parsing media files for almost ten minutes.,3,03/19/2019,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,No doubt VLC is one of the best in industry but it still has one issue _  whenever I transfer or download some videos _  it doesn't search the directory itself and update the list _  neither after refreshing it does the same. I have to uninstall the app and install the app again just to update the list. Please fix this issue.,3,03/27/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,its a great app _  all my various video formats play perfectly. mirrors to tv. i luv the play options 2 repeat ALL video files & shuffle _  instead of just from individual folders (like other video player apps). The Only issue i have with this app is that the Shuffle seems 2 be Faulty. when i startup app _  it seems2 already be on shuffle _  but its actually not. The videos just play in sequential order. So i turn shuffle off. Then on and still sequential. Then i have 2repeat a couple more times2 fix it,4,05/06/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,i gave 3 stars because i use to swear by vlc _  got so many people using it. but now when i click play on a song it's not working. i have to keep pushing play fast until it comes on. most the time it wont. and when i choose download a song and try to add to the app sometime it wont. this is my favorite music player please fix it. and it would be great if you could just create an account that way when you get a new phone u use can just log in and all your content will be there.,3,03/06/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,SMB streaming over WiFi has become completely unusable. Video plays for about a minute _  before freezing. Experimented streaming video that was encoded both using constant quality and constant bitrate in Handbrake. I want to note that I have eliminated all other possible hardware and software issues - other devices can stream the same content using a wired connection (tried lthe atest versions of VLC in Windows 10 _  MacOS X and Ubunutu 18.10/19.04).,1,05/04/2019,5
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Excellent. I love that it streams m3u over http. only problem is _  it keeps spontaneously launching and playing _  even if i force kill it (long hold on back button in dev options). Because of this _  I've had to uninstall it (can't have mucic unexpectedly start playing in the rest room _  or a meeting.) I've looked for a way to disable this in options _  but to no avail.,3,02/11/2019,17
App884,org.videolan.vlc,As an enthusiast of open source and Linux _  this has always been my prefered media player. The Android version is no exception. It has many features that the desktop version has including RSS. However _  if you're scared of lots of buttons _  I wouldn't reccomend it. With power comes responsibility.,5,03/29/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,was really good but then came the updates that completely ruined it for me. now it doesn't parse new media automatically like it used to. even after manually refreshing. i exit the app then go back in and the media files directory is lost. the updates come with so many bugs it's annoying. after so long with this app _  I'm forced to look elsewhere now. fix the bugs guys.,2,05/25/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Updates tend to break things. The most recent update (the one adding the onboarding screen) broke the interface to specify which directories to scan for media in because that menu was built for the onboarding screen and has no built in "okay" option _  it assumes the next button is available like it is during the onboarding. EDIT: okay _  this is the second time I've had to uninstall and reinstall to get my music library functional in as many weeks. Not acceptable _  you need integration tests.,2,04/29/2019,6
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Recent update prevents closing VLC after playing media: can't close it from the app window _  can't close it from the notification bar. Weak. Watch out if you have a time limit on your porn consumption. Also: Adding multiple songs to playlists is a crapshoot. You may or may not have to add each song one-by-one. Even if you do _  VLC will frequently start up with empty playlists or with incomplete playlists (missing items). Pretty lame _  dude.,1,04/28/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I really like this app _  but there's one problem that I always meet Sometimes when I copy a song from my PC to my Phone _  VLC doesn't detect the song that I just copied I've tried to restart both the app and my phone over and over again _  but it still doesn't detect it But when I change the filename of the song or move it to another folder _  the app did detect it _  and when I put it back to normal _  the app doesn't detect it again If I uncheck the directory then check it again _  my playlist will be gone,4,03/25/2019,2
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Probably the best all-around player app _  hats off to developers. Just one little complaint: when a song is playing and I want to pull up the player menu bar _  since I use gesture navigation (OnePlus 6T) _  I sometimes close the app by swiping up. Just a slight annoyance _  I guess the solution is to make the bar a little taller. I can totally live with it tho _  just wanted to point this out since gesture based control is becoming more widespread.,5,12/02/2018,60
App884,org.videolan.vlc,As much as I've liked the app _  it is extremely frustrating that everytime I go to turn my screen off to just listen to the music it will stop playing after a couple seconds and won't continue until I turn my screen back on. SUPER counter-intuitive on an app that plays music _  even if it was designed primarily for video. .,2,03/17/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Please add feature to seek (+5/10/15 and -5/10/15 seconds ) and touch seek for mp3 files ( audio player ). The existing seek options ( <-  -> ) thought similar arrows is not useful as it we have to press it for long then suddenly it take you to 30/40/50 more seconds back or forward.  Please add such feature immediately ( same one like in video player it is available). I am a student. I need to listen to audio lectures so please develop this features.,4,06/05/2019,3
App884,org.videolan.vlc,It's good to see that VLC has improved a lot. So I will be pointing out the small things that could make the overall experience even better. 1) Pause/play - at present VLC only allows to play the video from the last position only if it was started within the app itself. If the video was started from the gallery of the phone _  replay starts from the beginning. 2) Stopping a video by scrolling to the end of the timeline is not instant. 3) Media categorization should have the same folder structure.,3,07/10/2019,169
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Probably the best overall music/media player for android _  my ONLY issue is sometimes when starting tracks _  the app will skip the first second or so of audio _  and the same goes for the ending of tracks _  it will cut off part of the end of a track _  which can be a large nuisance when trying to listen to an album with transitions smoothly _  this is NOT a problem with many other media players... if this were to be fixed there would be ABSOLUTELY NO QUESTION that this is the best player.,3,07/24/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Love using this app for my music and vids. But lately _  it has bugs where some of my mp3 songs doesn't appear bec. it couldn't read all the files properly. Also _  some of my music and vids who doesn't have thumbnails appears to use the thumbnails of other files. I find it kinda disturbing. It doesn't appear to be like this before. Kindly please do something about it. Thank you.,3,08/03/2019,76
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Great player. playspeed glitch with folders. When i play some audio files like podcasts at a higher speed _  then in the same temp playlist _  choose a folder I added _  the app will stall forever. and the temp playlist will only return if i press play with a bluetooth device. there should also be a touchscreen option to continue playback. it'd be good to have A to B repeat playback.,4,08/18/2019,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,For some reason audio quality is really terrible and unpleasant. When I play the same videos on MX Player _  the audio quality is much better on MX Player. I still won't use MX Player because they threw ads into their app that interrupt video playback _  which is pathetic. I am on an ASUS Zenfone. I use the VLC app on other android phones and it is perfectly fine. But for some reason _  on this phone _  on the VLC app _  the audio quality is really bad and unpleasant compared to other apps.,3,12/03/2019,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,This would be the best app if you could stream your iptv video from phone to pc. It currently plays the stream from pc only. The pc app is more flexible.. It is still a good app.,4,12/18/2019,3

App884,org.videolan.vlc,as expected _  works very good. very convenient to tap on the side to fast forward _  use 2 fingers in the middle to enlarge the image _  etc. there are minor bugs in my android 4.4 but no big deal.,5,12/18/2019,5
App884,org.videolan.vlc,All I wanted from a Media Player Android TV application is the ability to play all the movie files I plug into it from a USB flash drive. Simple. VLC managed to partially do this before _  i.e. play all media files in a flash drive _  but even that went out the window with the latest update. What is the point of forcing the user to click on every single file before it plays? I can't see how that makes sense to the stereotypical user _  so I've moved on to a hassle-free competitor.,3,11/10/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,it seems very strange bug in this so called best player _  _ it automatically decreases the brightness when watching movie then as display tap it make it higher _  _ how do this is happening _  _  _ sorry developers uninstaling it _  _  _ ,1,12/08/2019,5
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Kept getting shut down if paused for longer than a few minutes and I had manually scroll to where I left off. VLC is great for desktops but I will not recommend it for Android phones.,1,12/10/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,The recent update is a mess.☹️. The previous one was the best👍. As much as I hate it _  I now feel like uninstalling the app. Please fix everything in the app it is a total wreck.,2,12/15/2019,0

App884,org.videolan.vlc,iPHONE users listen up: ONLY the Android version has the highly sought after feature of 200% volume. Because Apple wants to control everything Apple ....iPhone users cannot use their phones to the fullest potential with VLC. Again if you have an iPhone you CANNOT use 200% VOLUME because Apple is greedy and charges more for AppleCare as the standard 1 year warranty does not include replacement due to speaker wear. VLC....APPLE.....get it together and allow IPHONE users to use 200% volume. Apple....... you're getting paid again anyway when people crack their screens and buy new phones.Quit being so greedy and controlling and UPDATE VLC player for iPhone to allow 200% VOLUME. This is why as as iPhone users to _ I still have an Android backup. Apple is so GREEDY. ..,3,02/22/2020,0

App884,org.videolan.vlc,This used to be the best video player on Android. But since the last couple of updates the Video list will no longer refresh when either new files are added or others deleted. The Video list remains fixed in time. The only way to find an added file is go to to the Directories tab and navigate to the folder then play the file from there. Even then it still will not appear in the Video list. The only way to get the video list to refresh is to completely reinstall the app. FIX THIS!!!!!,1,05/16/2019,70
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Its pretty good. i have 3 issues though: sometimes when i open the app _  it has to parse all audio files on my device and the only fix is to kill the app and restart it. another issue _  is searching for music in the queue _  when i type a song name _  it doesnt find it or it just gives me a random list of songs completely unrelated to my search. finally abother issue would ve nice to have a favorite feature _  where you can favorite songs as they play throughout the queue. this wouldcreate favorites list,2,02/18/2019,13
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Its a great experience. This app has always been one of the best media players  _  infact  _  the best . I would recommend u all to download VLC only and no other media players . The best thing is the quality and it now also allows to download subtitles. This makes the app very good. Happily download it.,5,04/18/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Works great for playing music loaded into the phone. Streaming though is another matter. Pause your stream for more than a few seconds and you have to start over. That is really annoying when you are 60 minutes into an 90 minute show and have to listen to that 60 minute over again tonget to where you paused.,3,10/22/2018,28
App884,org.videolan.vlc,My go-to app on Windows _  but frustrating experience on Android: (1) Not able to "save" my selected media library folders in Setrings _  once I finish the first setup screens.

App884,org.videolan.vlc,probably the best mobile video player app. Problems to fix: 1. video rate speed goes down to 25% would be nice to have it come down to 3 fps like the desktop version. 2. somehow incorporate a frame by frame forward button. and a back 1 frame by frame would be awesome if possible 3. The play from A;B does not work well. it is awkward to set with the menu and you can only set it with the video playing. Things to add like the PC version:,4,05/07/2019,2
App884,org.videolan.vlc,This is the go to app for playing video on my Nvidia Shield TV. The only issue is SMB authentication for accessing secured NAS's. It absolutely will not accept credentials _  while the VLC for IOS _  used on my iPhone and iPad _  have no issues. I have scoured VLC forums _  and see multiple posts with same issue _  but no resolution.,3,02/25/2019,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,My mp4 videos used to work perfectly fine before. Now a black screen with the traffic cone logo connected to a casting(?) icon shows up while the audio still plays. I'm not trying to cast it to a TV. Also _  when I open the videos from my phone's original player _  they still work _  so the source mp4 files are not corrupted. Please fix this. I loved this app when it worked.,1,04/04/2019,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Used and tried vast number of music players in my Android devices. This app is simply the BEST. It is free _  contains no adds nor in-app purchases. Maybe it is not so visually "glamorous" than some other players but is easy and explicit to use. My mobile memory is filled up by mp3's _  mainly complete album. I simply find VLC player easiest to use. After months of extensive use _  it has NEVER crashed nor have not had any malfunctions :) :),5,10/31/2018,11
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I don't know what happened in the last updates _  but it somehow really messed up. I've been using VLC for ages _  and it is a reference to me. But I've had a lot of issues lately (my musics disappear from the list when using or loading the app _  the refresh button doesn't work _  it doesn't recognize the album of some files...). I'll stop using this app soon if those issues are not fixed.,4,06/24/2019,261
App884,org.videolan.vlc,this app is cool and all _  but the annoying thing is if you add new audio files _  the app just doesn't detect it. But after I uninstall and reinstall it _  after the initial media parsing _  that file finally detected by the app. So every time I add new file _  I just reinstall the pp. The auto scan just doesn't work. Please fix this _  I love this app. Thank you.,3,04/05/2019,270
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Wow! I've been using VLC since 5 years on my PC. Now _  I'm using in my mobile. It supports formats like Flac _  M4A that other audio players don't support. And Quality of playing both Audio and Video is slightly better than other media players. However it lags a little in some parts. Hopefully _  there will be a performance improvement update in the future I think.,5,05/31/2019,4
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Awesome Video Player! Fixed My Chromecast Lag! Edit: Casting no longer working and audio sync issues,2,03/08/2020,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I use it for listening to classical music albums. It mostly works well. The music is displayed nicely according to the metadata _  and the user interface is good. Format support is good. However _  the pause button has no functionality. A few minutes after clicking the pause button _  the last song is no longer displayed and the place is lost. This seems like a very very basic music player function. Other music players are able to keep track of the last place in ALL the music through a history function. Unfortunately _  other players have huge bugs or inept metadata handling. So VLC looks like the best at this moment.,4,08/04/2019,111
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Previous to the June 2019 update _  I had no problems and would have given this app a 5 star rating. Since the update _  some of my camera movies that ran flawlessly on the previous version _  now have audio problems that I can't find any way to correct!! The audio sounds like (uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh) etc _  you get the picture! I want to "Thank " the creators of this app and hope that they can correct this problem? I have a Samsung S7 android phone.,2,08/14/2019,192
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Guys if you are looking for a music app that plays in the background try Breathe Music. it works fantastic. I plays when the phone is asleep and when I'm driving. I have all my files loaded on my phone. I select my file and then click the dots on the right to pull in the album and top the file name. It seems I have to tap the name again otherwise it won't play but the original file selected. I haven't done this a lot so maybe that was just a glitch.,2,09/11/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Worked just fine six months ago but since these terrible updates...it can't find video _  it refuses to play video _  you have to move video out of different directories & put them in the root directory of VLC for this program to even recognize that the bideo exists.😑 My analysis: VLC is one of the best for home computers but for the cell phone...their just not ready yet. In my opinion...too much work. There are too many other programs out there that you don't have to go through all of this! 🤷‍♂️,1,11/22/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Best video player without ads. It Has some impressive features with Great ui. I think you should add a audio player option with sleep mode. Thanks to you developer guys for making a great app like this,4,02/02/2020,16
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Love the app and know it's capabilities _  so purely because of its availability on Android I had to have it. There's a big issue I'd note _  which didn't happen until mid 2019 (unsure if caused by updates): the app will keep opening itself automatically _  either out of nowhere or after use. It'll do it and interrupt other apps _  and continues nonstop _  neverending... Uninstalling and reinstalling temporarily fixes the issue until it eventually happens again.

I have to force close the app and restart the video and try to scroll to where I stopped. It used to be able to resume my videos when I exit them prematurely. Very disappointed. Pls fix this issue.,1,05/02/2019,9
App884,org.videolan.vlc,To summarize my experience with the application: It's a very brilliant video veiwing software that has a lot of diverse features that makes me choose VLC over others _  these features range from slow motion _  an in-depth audio functionality to many others. my reasoning for rating this 4 stars is when upon opening video files and veiwing them from social media platforms _  search engines _  Etc _  there wasn't a way (that I know of) to download the video file that was being viewed with the application.,4,03/28/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,request feature : on my laptop _  i have reset my up and down arrow keys to fine-increase playback speed _  and my right and left arrow keys to very-short move forward or backward. this helps me a lot while listening to study lectures because i can increase or decrease my playback speed as well as go back/forward very easily _  only using 4 keyboard keys. i request that such a feature to be introduced in vlc for Android with a physical keyboard so i can carry a lightweight tablet leaving my laptop,4,04/03/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,•1. I used this app for as long as I bare _  it is a great app but it has some serious problems with hi-bitrate and hi-frame-rate videos _  and I mean very very serious problems like 2 to 3 seconds of pause/hiccups just to change from portrait to landscape _  and on my current phone that's just not acceptable. •2. I will have to find other player for my "basic" needs.,3,12/28/2018,43
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I succeeded in streaming movies from my laptop on android phone. Movie plays good but there are few bugs you need to fix. 1. Drives from my laptop on local network do not appear sometimes _  i have to force stop VLC app for it to work. 2. Sometimes i cannot play movies even though i can browse the folders on local network. 3. Sometimes name of the movies while playing appear in garbage values. For eg. Movie name is "Black panther" Then it shows "Mdjdidkrjlsssgskkwvdh",4,09/22/2018,2
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Please add a better option for exploring videos. I have up to 600 videos and it is always difficult to find a video. I end up scrolling back snd forth and not even finding the video I want. The sorting option should have ascending and descending option. When using date sorting for example the list should go to the newest video. The sorting option shouldn't reset after an app restart. You guys should improve the folder option where only folders containing videos should be shown.,3,01/11/2019,58
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I had a disagreement with a producer over a mix i was sent _  due to VLC. the pitch was shifting in the song. when i heard it at first i thought i was losing my mind _  but a peer heard it as well. long story short _  it was VLC that was creating the pitch warble. when listening to it on literally any other media player it wasn't warbled like that. upon researching the problem it was instantly obvious this is an ongoing problem the creators have yet to fix.,1,02/01/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,The player itself is great! I like the interface _  and I use VLC on all my devices. However _  the Android version keeps "parsing media" and removing songs or entire albums from my library. Since this happens across multiple android devices _  I can safely conclude that it is not a hardware error. Often times I'm forced to uninstall and reinstall so VLC can read my whole media library again. This has become a weekly process _  and therefore I give this app one star. Would give zero if I could.,1,06/09/2019,28
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Can't get it to continue playing when my phone turns off and locks the screen _  which is why I installed it as I hoped it'd continue playing even when that happens. Any advice on how I can get it to do that would improve my rating. Yes I'm aware I can prevent the phone doing that but it overheats and drains the battery super fast. Which is why I'd like it to play with the screen off and locked. Still a good app other than that,3,05/31/2019,8
App884,org.videolan.vlc,This piece of trash always scans for directories despite me turning the feature off and crashes about 2 minites into the scan _  if I try and go into the options to disable scanning bia individual directories it says I can't because it's scanning. So it's in a constant loop of scanning and crashing and there's nothing I can do to stop it _  it's horrible software and hasn't been fixed in a long time. Not giving this another chance ever again.,1,07/16/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,VLC has improved a lot in the past year as a music player. I'm really happy to see that. Hence the five stars. Unfortunately _  I'm having an issue with the small area for appending a song to the current play list. I repeated hit it and mistakenly play the song instead; ruining my playlist docked with maybe a dozen songs. Even aware of this issue _  I still can't reliably hit the three dots for the track menu. It's very frustrating. Also _  History view doesn't allow appending to playlist. Thanks.,5,07/30/2019,61
App884,org.videolan.vlc,It's pretty good. I like that I can use double tap for seeking (RW/FF) _  it's just that I wish I can set how long the jump is _  e.g. 5 seconds. Currently _  I can't change the seek interval time to my preference because it's locked to 10s. It's one of the most basic features a video player should have in this day and age that even YouTube app (not exactly a "video player") have the option to change the seek interval. Come on _  VLC.,4,07/22/2019,42
App884,org.videolan.vlc,100% recommend.Great app with many features. But for Samsung In the portrait mode _  the video controls are in the same position of navigation bar. So I can't control the app. Hope you make the option to change the play speed directly from the interface (e.g. by swiping vertically like forwarding but from the top of scree in the Audio hope you add (Directories) to (Artisits _  Albums _ ..). I know I can choose from outside to open all Directories. But want to only show Directories have audio files.,5,12/01/2019,2
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Hi _  After the latest update with the ui changed and all the fast forward when we press double click isn't smooth and it sometimes doens't work at all so it becomes v irritating... Hope you guys give a solution for the same ASAP..,2,12/12/2019,3
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Good player _  but latest update broke way too many things. Now I need to recreate all my playlists from scratch. Devs need to test before releasing broken updates.,1,12/11/2019,3
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I don't like the new update _  I can't even play my videos as audio again. The former one was better _  this new update should have just been only to fix the bugs in Android 10.0. Pls I love VLC _  the tech guys should do something about it.,2,12/20/2019,2
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Love it so far _  have no problems yet.,5,12/28/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,VLC is by far the best app i have used in a while but I dont know why but each time i try to download a movie subtitle i doesnt work _ till when i can get to download subs i will still just be giving it two stars,2,02/02/2020,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Could'a & Should"a been 5 ☆ but last update you've had seemed to eliminate the casting to another device(ex. My T.V) C'mon figure it out fast before you lose all of your patrons you do deserve! Stay in the game y'all are great who made VLC possible..,4,02/15/2020,0

App884,org.videolan.vlc,Consistently the best and most reliable app for video and audio. No intrusive or bandwidth wasting adverts _  just a great _  easy to use and reliable app from an attentive and honest developer.,5,12/22/2019,18
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Anytime I use this app and I want to play the music and after music have played and want to change always the music would play in a single without itself changing unless you use shuffle so that itself can change,3,12/25/2019,1

App884,org.videolan.vlc,It's great but when I put it to repeat a track or movie _  it starts the repeat at a random spot _  NOT at the beginning of the track. The repeat feature is broken. MKV files do NOT play properly _  the video breaks apart and becomes unwatchable. The UI could be better also _  the icons need to be spelled out or else I don't know what some of the buttons are for. I knocked off 1 star from my previous 4 stars because of these glaring issues. Please fix these features _  I like this app _  thank you!,3,08/25/2019,127
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Found it impossible to contact support team so leaving this here I used to be able to stream files from smb server _  but this suddenly stopped on all devices. No issue with server _  as I can see the files there on same device using file explorer Why this has happened and how this can be resolved Only left 1 star to attract your attention,1,11/16/2018,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I like this app. But here's my problem that need to fix 1) Deleting the video files on PC _  the file still show the video like it is still exist and new video I put in won't show it. 2) After moving my videos from internal to SD card _  the file now showing two same file name. I just wish the developers should fix this problem so I don't have to uninstalled and redownload again.,3,10/13/2018,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Latest version is not compatible with my Samsung Galaxy J2 Core. Uninstalled the latest and reinstalled an older one so that I can play my mp3s.,1,03/22/2020,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,There must be some additional featutes/options inside the app for perfection: ▪︎Remember sorting types (name _  name desc _  date _  date desc _  etc.) ▪︎ Balance audio volumes if this option is checked ▪︎ Sorting types inside the directories and folders must also be various (not only sorting by name) ▪︎Audio play-list menu must have sorting feature _  too These are some must-have features and options I spontaneously remembered to write as an app review.,4,03/23/2019,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,As a music player this is by far the best music app out there. I've tried cointless apps for organizing my own music collection (60gb) and found they are _all_ lacking. VLC has a great interface _  logical organization _  intuitive _  fast _  doesnt bog down my phone and has good sound quality. Also _  pretty much the only music app for local playback of music on chromecast/audio. Finally. Awesome!,5,03/23/2019,10
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I love VLC. I use nothing else for playing video content. However _  casting to my Chromecast device on my television. Has proven to be a pain. Sometimes it works _  sometimes it plays but is super choppy _  and sometimes the video simply won't cast. I'm not sure if this is a Chromecast or VLC issue _  but I'd love some feedback.,4,11/04/2018,5
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Plays movies smoother than all my other media players love the funcionality too(lock screen _  independent brightness/volume. very annoying bug right now if i leave/switch app it wont reopen _  just stays black screen _  even if i try to play another movie. i have to clear or force close it and start over. so i cant reply to messages while im watching and have to remember where i was in my movie every time i leave app. xperia XA2 Ultra,2,04/11/2019,6
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Doesn't work with the latest versions of android & firefox. It no longer comes up as an option for opening video...even when it is installed. Have found no solutions to the problem. Problem presented itself right after a major update to the phones OS and after updating apps...including VLC. Can't determine where the problem is (with OS _  with Firefox/Mozilla _  or with VLC)....or how to fix it.,1,10/08/2018,15
App884,org.videolan.vlc,No real problems with playback. Importing albums from itunes on my pc to my phone works great. However _  the phone app's own playlist system is entirely unusable. I had to google around to figure out how to reorder tracks _  adding tracks is time consuming (have to add them one by one _  instead of say adding a whole folder at once) _  and duplicate tracks will randomly get added to the playlist _  which can't be deleted without also deleting all other copies. Also _  it is impossible to import a playlist file from pc _  even after correcting file paths. Overall _  works fine if you don't intend on adding any custom playlists.,2,05/25/2019,4
App884,org.videolan.vlc,does what you want it to. but don't you dare open literally any other app while it's casting cause it will definitely stop the cast and will most likely also refuse to display the cast button ever again. as in _  you will definitely have to reinstall the app to have even a sliver of hope of ever casting again.,1,03/23/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Seems to have an issue with dropping/resuming streams. Other apps I've used for IP streams don't have an issue maintaining connection and then retrying IF it does drop. I am sitting on top of my router and testing this _  and every station drops after a minute or two _  then eventually will not start again.  This is not a device/connection issue. Other apps work fine. I gave VLC a shot because they are a trusted name. The playlist editing features are also weak _  can't even reorder things.  I'd expect much better from VLC. For streaming stick with Xiaalive _  and for on-device or cloud use google music. Done.,1,04/21/2019,52
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I like the app _  but I don't like the way you manage it or frankly fixing your bugs! The app is full of bugs _  one of them is that when I play a video from the app _  I can't change the orientation without crashing the app (at the same moment I rotate my device). Another thing _  I can't select a subtitle file from the same directory while I am playing the video unless I go back to my home directory and reach the place of the video manually. The issue is that it keeps loading and shows no filesCONTINUE,5,01/16/2019,14
App884,org.videolan.vlc,The dropdown menu used to work  _  i could pause and replay  _  skip or go back a song.. now its just sitting there  _  doing nothing when I press the buttons. If I want to skip a song or just Pause it.. I need to go into vlc and pause it there.. This used to be my preferred music/video player.. but after the update it just ruined it for me. Please _  if possible  _  fix this. I'm using a Huawei P9 lite.,1,04/14/2019,17
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I used VLC on my PC for years so this is what I went to immediately for mobile on my android. Wow am I glad I did! Not only does it play videos well but it has great features to top it all off _  like a secondary brightness and controls you can use with swiping around or double-tapping during the video without the clutter of a UI. Very well designed! Great work! This is the design and development that keeps me as a fan for life. Much love and respect _  Videolabs! ✌️🤜🤛,5,06/02/2019,9
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I use the subtitle download in this app. Unfortunately I don't seem to know what I am doing wrong. The subtitles always seem to be off either to fast or to slow it never matches the audio. I've used the. subtitle delay but pressing either plus or minus it doesn't change anything. Since I don't see instructions nor a help button I guess I can go without it.,4,06/02/2019,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Excellent media player. Plays absolutely anything _  video or audio. Also plays streams. About the only player app that isn't completely dumbed down. The only one that lets you browse files and folders on your device. One major flaw: playlist function is BADLY BROKEN! Adds multiple copies of tracks randomly _  sometimes seems to dump entire folders of media into an existing playlist _  totally unreliable.,3,11/17/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Some issues playing mp3 audios since the last two or three updates ( It all of a sudden stops or pauses playing the audios _  making you hit the play button again to be able to continue).

App884,org.videolan.vlc,it's a very nice app just that it keeps thumbnails of deleted movies from my memory card. I just upgraded to the latest version _  yet those thumbnails are still there and when I try to play this deleted movies whose thumbnails are showing on the vlc using the vlc player _  it still can't play so I can't justify any reason why this thumbnails can't just go away. My roommate has same issue with his VLC _  so I'm not the only one. you guys should please sought this out,4,06/27/2019,10
App884,org.videolan.vlc,There are a number of flaws: 1. Takes a lot of time to seek to a particular time (like in case of 20-30 secs _  I might have as well watched that part.) 2. If I have put on subtitles _  and I've come to home screen once _  then after coming back to the app _  they disappear. And don't display again until you kill the app and restart it. 3. The auto rotation behaves weirdly.,2,07/03/2019,465
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Horrible. somehow the app plays music from where it's stop instead of starting afresh. i.e _  if say a 4mins music is paused or stopped at 2mins _  even if it's one week later(it doesn't matter how long) _  it's starts from that middle whenever u want to play it again and i have checked all the vlc settings and no way to resolve it. This is only seen in video app _  to enable you start from where u stop _  definitely not music. Its been a good app for years _  but totally horrible and annoying to use now.,1,07/27/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I really like VLC. But there are two things I would improve. On the PC version you can go over 100%. we should be able to do this on Android because sometimes on buses I cannot hear. Also when I skip ahead the AV sync goes out. It takes forever to use the plus and minus to sync them back. It would be nice to be able to just type in a number like I can with other players I have downloaded specifically for that reason.,4,07/17/2019,28
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Can't pick up playing audio where it left off... if I am playing an album in the car _  stop to get a coffee and come back _  it complains that it cannot play the rest of the songs in its queue. Starting the same album from the beginning works fine. This has been a problem since I started trying to use the Android version. Does anyone know of an app that will simply play MP3s from my device (on Android Auto) without problems? Because I have yet to find one.,2,08/16/2019,148
App884,org.videolan.vlc,before version was good. after updating it recent version is worst. now one cant delete video from vlc player easily . no options for deleting video.. secondly now you cant play video as an audio easily . worst version,1,12/08/2019,8
App884,org.videolan.vlc,For the most works very well _  save for the fallowing exceptions. Mobile version a bit thin on tools compared to D.T. ...but still good stuff As in all versions can get glitches... OK so ask for your money back. Yep you paid Nada _  so don't bitc did ting is fin fin tactic..MAN! Disclaimer: Hard as it may be understand this _  I'm actually a very stupid person so I'll just say the learning curve what's a bit more than I expected however that was on the desktop so cut me some slack already. GET IT,4,12/05/2019,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I love the app _  efficient _  plays any video. However _  the music playing experience with the app is just off but there is still space for improvement.,3,12/13/2019,6

Rightnow user cannot even see when actually the points on both sides are set or not.

App884,org.videolan.vlc,Everything went well until I updated my android to Oreo. Now player voluntarily switches between tracks in inappropriate moments.

App884,org.videolan.vlc,player is good... but when it come to being able to delete a file that's were this app has problems.

App884,org.videolan.vlc,This is the 1st time I installed this app. I didn't even played a single file yet but 2 things I already disliked. 1st thing is view. When I go in videos _  all videos are viewed together and when I go to directories _  all folders are viewed. Even those which does not contain any media file. Very bad display of UI. 2nd thing is time it takes to search for media. It took 10x more time as compared to MX Player. MX player can refresh the whole library within seconds,2,02/28/2019,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Recent updates have brought serious problems: will rescan / parse device library nearly every time the app is launched or tabbed back into _  even when this function is disabled in options. As well _  proper filenames are not displayed _  and some files just don't show up in directories at all _  such as certain mp3 or m4a files that show in other apps. Also _  didn't this app used to have a widget?,2,06/08/2019,4
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Was a highly recommended 5. Now a low2. The video files on my phone & tablet no longer show as video files & as such all features for video no longer applicable to them or this application. Since I do not use this for music it's almost completely worthless to me now. It can hold files & play them but it won't keep the place of the file _  say the length _  show a distinct icon or tell me if it has been watched before or not. The stock Samsung app does more for me than this app does now. Back to it.,2,03/27/2019,3
App884,org.videolan.vlc,versions before 3.0 are great _  but why was the equalizer removed in new version? I had to find an old installer and turn off auto update because 3.1  went downhill. all my mp3s vanished 2 days after update. I recommend version 2.9 _  also for ppl trying to add new mp3s _  if they don't show in list then go to directories tab and uncheck your music folder and recheck it _  that will re-parse mp3s without having to reinstall,4,04/21/2019,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,This app is very convenient because it'll play several filetypes which android doesn't (out of the box). The onscreen controles are intuitive and I have yet to find another video playing app which'll allow you to lock your screen for playback (as in _  you can wipe a small stain off've your display without interrupting playback) which is very helpful if you travel a lot. sine VLC is available for PC and I also use it there _  I trust this brand and thus _  this app.,4,04/17/2019,24
App884,org.videolan.vlc,It seems to be not functioning well and as it should be on my S9+ _  i had to uninstalled and reinstalled the app a few times in 1 month _  and its been 3 months ive been doing so. I port in new TV Series from my PC _  but it doesn't show up in the video list _  some of the TV series i deleted using the PC interface is still showing in the VLC video list. I need to uninstalled and reinstalled _  so the correct video list will be shown. I have another video app nPlayer on the phone and it works great _  but drain batt fast _  so i use VLC instead. Pls help to fix this VLC _  you have a great app _  but if its this troublesome _  might as well switch to other apps. P.S. _  i had to uninstalled and reimstalled twice last week~,2,09/30/2018,81
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I've been using this app for years now. I haven't had a problem with it until it updated automatically _  so I disabled auto update on all apps. my only issue back then was that when I pause it _  the app closes. then I decided to update last night _  maybe it was fixed... aaand now I can no longer play music and it's buggy so I decided to uninstall it. what a let down.,1,01/27/2019,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I loved this player when I had it on my old S2. Unfortunately the search bar does not seem to work anymore now that I am using an S8. Also when you are in the directories tab and use the android _  built in _  back button it just loads forever (unless you close and reopen the app). This only occurs when you go back to the first screen however _  so is not too much of an issue. :),3,11/11/2018,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Anytime I add new audio files to my phone _  I have to completely remove the app and re-download it in order for the new files to show up. I have tried to force stop and then start it again _  but that doesn't help. It's a pretty good app for the most part _  it just has this one frustrating flaw.,3,03/30/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,For actually playing music/video _  it works fine. The trouble starts with playlists _  they are so janky it makes listening to downloaded songs in order an absolute chore. EDIT 12/6/19: The playlists are better from when I first started _  but now the app keeps crashing when it does a scan that I did not request _  and it keeps happening at startup even when I disabled it. Literally unusable and a complete mockery of the desktop VLC,2,12/06/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I've had VLC installed for a long time. It was configured to access a shared drive on my home computer. I would open "Local Network" then open my home computer and I would see one folder labeled "Q". That was the shared drive on my home computer and VLC would play those files. I no longer see the "Q" drive. I see 4 folders labeled "Music" _  "Videos" _  "Pictures" and "Playlists". When I open those folders and their subfolders everything is empty. Why can't I access my shared drive anymore? Is there a bug in a recent update?,2,06/26/2019,20
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I love this App. But want an update in Playback Speed option. You see Playback Speed is only having + & - symboled options and finger can be used. But + & - help to in/decrease as .05 but fingers also not enough. For example I m unable to set the speed up to 1.08 b. Like how Jump to time is having the keypad to set time. Think Playback Speed option is also having number keypads with + & - symboled options. Due to which anybody can set the exact speed of any song or audio whichever they want.,5,07/01/2019,11
App884,org.videolan.vlc,hey _  Deb's _  this app drives me nuts. Localfiles _  Bluetooth connections _  streaming background files _  DLC consulate drops connections _  forgets where it was _  randomly _  if I change sources _  Wi-Fi networks _  or if I don't _  it just seems to have a mind of its own. I am on a Galaxy Note 9. Any help at all? I posted something on Reddit _  and it just sat there. Are you guys even working on this app? It feels dead.,3,07/30/2019,27
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Navigation is made difficult because of the non-intuitive UI. Something as simple as navigating up a directory is impossible _  or if it is possible _  then I've yet to learn how. Another problematic aspect is playlists - I can play all files in a folder no problem _  but the problems arise when I want to play files from 2 or more folders or even just add more files to my current playlist. It has the same playback issues as the PC version - if you want to loop a video _  on most videos _  expect VLC to skip the first seconds when replaying as well as a delay between the video ending and the video restarting (though this seems to be less noticable in "play as audio" mode). And for some reason _  VLC insists that it will play back where I left off _  it will even do this sometimes when looping a video _  i.e. _  video ends _  VLC jumps to the middle instead of the start. And _  strangely _  the option to turn this feature off is missing. Very annoying. It has many big and small quirks like this that just make the whole experience frustrating.,2,08/02/2019,19
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I picked up this app ad an audiobook player. Went in _  found my place in the book to prepare for later. When i opened it later and pressed play _  it began the book from the beginning. Rushed and found my place again _  not happy. I set a 15 minute timer. After the timer went off _  guess what. Playback unavailable. Pressing play starts the book over again. Now _  Im finding my olace again and looking for a new app to listen to it in. "Editor's Choice" was way off with this one.,1,08/04/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,It seems that every time there's an update _  something convenient changes. For example _  on my previous device using vlc 2.5.13 I could raise the volume more than 100 %. But on my new device _  running v. 3.1.7 _  I can't. This makes it almost useless for using in the gym _  which is the main place I need to use it. 1 more thing - online support is geared for techies _  not the average user who just wants to watch videos while on the treadmill.,2,08/26/2019,291
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Getting buggier with every update. New UI sucks. What happened VLC? Used to be a really good media player. But lately _  the quality of VLC has dropped. While playing videos if you move the seek bar _  it freezes the video and won't play at all. You have to stop the video and restart it from the beginning or go to a new video and then go back to it. And then there's the playback speed. Years ago it used to work so well with such smoothness. Now regardless of speed _  audio is HORRIBLY distorted.,2,11/20/2019,6
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Absolute must-have app _  my default player for video and audio. The only problem is that when playing high kbps FLACs (which is most FLACs) from an SD card at the start of the song it will play normally for around a second _  then stay silent for about a second _  and then play like normal for the rest of the song _  which is pretty annoying and doesn't happen on other similar apps.,5,11/22/2019,9
App884,org.videolan.vlc,This app needs more low ratings due to problems with refreshing the music library. Everytime you add mp3 files to your device _  you must uninstall VLC then reinstall it for your media files to show in the library. The refresh function doesn't work and hasn't worked in the year that I've been using VLC for android. It simply shows a bar at the bottom of the screen that says "parsing media" _  and when it is complete _  you will find that your music has not been added. Still better than Google play tho.,2,10/10/2019,421
App884,org.videolan.vlc,This was an amazing app.. until the most the most recent update. I've never seen an update remove so many loved features before! Sorting _  deleting _  fitting.. the chopping list is endless.,1,12/09/2019,2
App884,org.videolan.vlc,It was perfectly fine _  not until with the recent update which has f***** everything up _  mixing videos up _  no delete function and more _  it's really intolerable.,2,12/12/2019,5

App884,org.videolan.vlc,It's infuriating that this is the best app to play music actually on your phone _  but it seems to be. I'm endlessly annoyed by it playing music from my pocket randomly after my phone disconnects from bluetooth devices _  and it's dogshit playback system HAS NO SETTING to make songs play from the beginning _  instead of wherever it left off the last time.,2,10/23/2019,0

App884,org.videolan.vlc,Almost perfect. VLC has so far been pretty stable _  and most features are elegant and enjoyable. Heres a small list of problems: When playback of a playlist begins _  or there isn't a song currently cached _  VLC will cut out the first couple seconds of a song. Parsing takes WAY too long _  in my opinion. I'm switching over from EQ Media Player _  every time I changed a tag _  or added a new song _  I'd have to rescan. But _  EQ rescanned my 800 song playlist in seconds. VLC takes upwards of 2.5 minutes.,4,04/17/2019,12
App884,org.videolan.vlc,App is working good. However _  it doesn't automatically sort videos by my preference _  it kinds of reset whenever I exit the app. I prefer my videos sorted by date and when I used the app for the first time I sorted it by date. I thought that when I exit the app and use it again later videos are still sorted in my preference but it doesn't. It always goes back to alphabetical order and I have to sort it out again. I ALWAYS do this whenever I use the app and it's getting annoying.,3,01/23/2019,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,This used to be my best app for watching videos and playing music but after the update its just trash _  really freaking annoying _  i like to play my movies and videos at a little fast speed now i cant _  with every music or video that plays i have to set it (before once i set it _  its always at that speed) _  it hangs a lot _  sometimes it doesn't even work _  please fix this its really annoying _  sometimes it takes me restarting my phone before i see my new music and videos. fix it please.,1,04/17/2019,81
App884,org.videolan.vlc,for a month now _  i am not able to open any video or audio directly from the app _  i have to go to file manger _  click on the item then open with vlc. i have to do this for each and every item on my play list. i tried to uninstall then reinstalled it again but no. the issue is still there _  kindly work on it. its frustrating that i have to search for a video all the way in storage just to watch it.,1,03/13/2019,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Hey _  I've been using VLC 4 android about (6+) years on my Android/PC devices now (Mainly Sony Xperia). I love the new update. The fact that the new user interface is easier to use is a big improvement. it's much better for listening to audio tapes & books than the previous installed 'APPS' keep doing your good work & we look forward to more good stuff. Thanks _  Samuel.N NAIROBI _ Kenya,5,05/26/2019,134
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I like how one of the questions that the rating system ask me directly _  is this app good for resuming content and the answer is absolutely not. On my Google pixel 2 I can listen to almost any type of file which is great. But when I hit the square navigation button on my phone _  the app is almost never able to resume the video. In fact Android sends me a toast message saying that this app is not available. more often than not it will restart VLC at its menu screen where it shows a list of hundreds of videos which I have deleted long long long ago. Then if I hit the play button it will try to automatically select a video based on alphabetical order it seems which will oftentimes be a video that does not exist anymore.,3,10/02/2018,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Recent update broken in several ways _  but I think that's the Android OS at fault for changing their layouts _  menus _  pop-up bars. If my phone sleeps while paused or stabbed out _  playback resumes with no sound _  requiring a restart _  and the position is not saved. This problem is since the update a week ago. Please fix. I'll give it back to your old 5 stars.,2,04/16/2019,997
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I just wanted to be able to play a video of us singing that I'd downloaded from the choir website. My Android J3 was saying no relevant app existed tho I had google Play and had downloaded another movie app to no avail. With VLC installed not only can I find and play the offending vid _  but I can stream another straight from the website without having to use up storage space.EDIT! I had to remove app after one day because it made playback very inflexible for things I'd recorded on samsung rec.,3,03/30/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Used to be brilliant but major bugs with the recent patches have killed the app! It often forgets all of the music on my memory card and it is a pain to get the app to rediscover them. Each time I have to use a new method to get the app to rediscover the media. Recently ran a half marathon and it forgot music half way through running which was a real pain as I had to listen to maybe 10 songs on repeat.,2,05/19/2019,12
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Make "shuffle" and "continuous loop" keep the settings I select - stop making me select them each time I open the app. If the app is open in the background _  it should autoplay when it connects via Bluetooth - because I was *obviously* just listening to it. Even if it's the *only* app _  in *still* shuts off. As a programmer _  this is absurdly easy to fix/change. Clearly these are "working as intended". So give us the option _  instead. Allow "default" settings of the *user's* choice instead of just "turning everything off all of the time". How am I the only one to mention these things?,3,09/29/2018,112
App884,org.videolan.vlc,This was one of the best players around. But since the last update most options don't function. Your streaming option from a local server no longer works and your SMB is now become sketchy at best. Your suggestion of downloading the apk file and rolling back a version until you solve the issues would be nice but i can't seem to install them. I've tried this on different android machines. Please roll the version back :-(,1,04/30/2019,2
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Your PAUSE function brings up a control screen that is way too opaque. No one can read subtitles/ CC that disappear too quickly to read. Please do make the pause overlay graphic more transparent. Also _  VLC _  when one swipes to go back or forward _  one very often hits and triggers your volume/ brightness gestures causing multiple unwanted experiences.,3,02/14/2019,9
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Adds entire album to queue for no reason.  I use VLC as an MP3 jukebox _  and I seem to constantly accidentally add an entire album to the queue.  I single click an album to see the individual tracks in the album.  I add one track to the queue _  but when I look at the queue _  the entire album is there.   And to make things worse _  the only way to clear my accidental selections is to remove each track from the queue one song at a time.  There is no option to clear the entire queue.,1,05/15/2019,35
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I used to love this player _  but since the least updated _  the PiP and play in background functions have stopped working properly. Most of the time it doesn't switch to PiP when you multitask now _  and even if you get it to do so it restarts your video. Playing in background stops working after 2 mins _  then when you switch back to player _  it restarts the video - doesn't even give you option to restart from previous point anymore.,2,05/24/2019,7
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I do not know what the hell is wrong with this app.I wanted to add subtitles to my video while casting it on my tv and I kept clicking on the option to add subtitles but all in vain .I was very frustrated with this problem so I switched to BubbleUPnp which is a lot more better than vlc for casting criteria.Even some movies were playing without audio in this bloody app but BubbleUpnP got it right.,1,10/16/2018,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Nice app but not the best. 1. It just doesn't play some videos. I had a video for the last 3 months _  it was working fine when suddenly vlc stops playing it. I had to force stop the app and then play it. I worked but again after closing it _  same problem. 2. If I close the app or phone (standby mode) during a video playback _  it doesn't open back neither when I turn on the phone nor when I switch vlc app again. Switching worked a few months earlier but now it doesn't. After turning on the phone from standby mode _  it closes the video and on opening the same video it first closes the background video on first tap and then opens the video on second tap. It's very very annoying _  fix this asap. 3. While adding subtitle to a video _  it pops up a window with a message- No subtitles in this directory _  even if I have subtitles there. The pop up window also shows a loading sign which doesn't close on tapping back button. To add subtitle _  I have to tap on home button and select the subtitle from the directory starting from the top.,3,10/22/2018,4
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I usually download videos on my phone and watch them on the go whenever I feel like it. However _  I am very bothered that the videos that I have already transferred to my PC/ renamed is still displayed on the videos section of the app as how they were before. I wish that this app could have a cleaner interface since it works well for my soft subbed videos.,1,02/19/2019,6
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Nice _  love for playing any kind of video _  particularly good for straming from NAS or a Desktop home device _  but also good for remote devices _  actually why is the "Local Network" section called "Local" if it can stream from remote devices (which was pretty obvious actually) it took me a minute to figure that out. Also the GUI of the actual video player is not that good _  if that was a little better I would be happy to give 5 stars.,4,04/11/2019,161
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I'd give it zero stars if I didn't have access to my songs even though I have to go all the way through the directories then go to my external SD card then click the music link to play anything. FIX IT!!!! I Put the whole library on the front page of the app at least 3 times probably more I've lost count & I had to calm down before writing this because if I didn't it would be filled with f-bombs and other curses. I loved the VLC player a lot WHEN it works,1,06/03/2019,7
App884,org.videolan.vlc,installed to play aiff tracks without iTunes. half the time I open the app it says 'found no media'. have to close/reload for another spin of the Roulette wheel. it doesn't automatically play the next track unless 'play all' selected from the individual tracks menu. pick another track and you have to repeat the process. my (Ford) car controls won't always work with the app. i need an app to play music in the car. this isn't it. going back to the Samsung app after converting my aiff files to mp3,2,05/30/2019,7
App884,org.videolan.vlc,a lot of improvements are required _  creating a playlist won't be easy for everyone _  you always have to refresh before you can see a downloaded file and the video names are mostly the same names one default in most cases. I must say I am a user _  but I have other more reliable apps way better in these areas. I have been a VLC before the mobile apps era.,1,06/09/2019,20
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Its good app. I can do complex mathematical calculations very faster using this.😅 Moreover the online tickets booking function is very much appreciated 😁. Also it converts word file to pdf very quickly. Thats really amazing 😜. It really is helpful to reduce your weight and keep you in shape. I never found such useful and multitasking app ever. Dont waste time..hurry please delete it immidately..😎😎,5,09/01/2019,8
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Great player _  but playlists are a mess and extremely buggy. Literally no way to reorder a playlist. I have a playlist with hundreds of audio clips to be played in a very certain order. 2 of them are out of order with literally no way to fix it. I'm not going to recreate it from scratch as a workaround to this annoyance. Just hope it gets fixed _  so I can once again ise VLC. I wish there was a direct donation you could make to devs to get any idea if work is being done on it.,4,09/05/2019,78
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Certainly better than Google Play Music in many ways. Especially the ability to play many formats. But I'd like to be able to reorganize playlists. As it is _  I can't. All I can do is remove songs from a playlist and re-add them in a different order. This is a tedious way to do it. And often _  it will put other songs out of order in the playlist and I have to completely remake the playlist. If these 2 things are fixed _  it will be 5 stars.,3,09/15/2019,109
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Plays whatever file you have _  which is great _  but the 'jump to time' function doesn't work. At all. Even dragging on the progress bar doesn't work. As soon as you lift your finger _  it starts again from the beginning. That would be fine on a three minute song _  not so fine on a 5 hour audiobook...,3,06/15/2019,23
App884,org.videolan.vlc,VLC is the best media player ever. I mean it _  it's second to none. Android / pc /xbox one _  if you have some file that nothing else will play _  not only will this open it _  it will play it well. Even if its got crazy 7.1 sound file and you're playing it on a mobile phone it will still work. I would give it 200% but that's not mathematically possible so 100% will have to do.,5,09/30/2019,172
App884,org.videolan.vlc,This is far better than my expectations!!! I was not disappointed by this app. But I loved the feature of downloading subtitles/captions a lot more. This feature is just amazing. Believe me guys you should try this one. I would have given 5 stars but due to some lack of development in zoom options I decided to give 4 stars. If the team fixes zoom feature it will be 5 star app. By the way this is amazing player.,4,10/07/2019,1726
App884,org.videolan.vlc,No "rewind" button. The author seems to be aware of "rewind" feature because it's possible to do by holding "previous" but only in playlist mode. It's extremely annoying to not be able to easily go back the few seconds you missed of your daily 15 minutes lesson or a story.,2,07/01/2019,8
App884,org.videolan.vlc,awesome app i have been using it for years. easiest _  fastest _  and most versatile. also best interface. i love how you can resume videos from the last point. great for when i download movies. one request-for the audio player i often download full albums and there is no way to resume playback from the last point like in video. could you please add that feature? otherwise i may consider finding a player that has that ability.,4,07/06/2019,1677
App884,org.videolan.vlc,UPDATE: After several months of use _  I had to update my review _  and drop a couple of stars. Frustrating and inconsistent quirks: When it is paused _  and then you click to resume _  this app might work correctly and continue playing. Or this app might stay open _  but close that particular mp3 file so you've lost your place. Or this app might totally shut down _  so you've again lost your place. If this happens _  then when you reopen the file _  maybe it will start where you had left off _  and maybe it won't. Losing your place isn't a big deal if it's a music file _  but if it's an audiobook or podcast _  then you'll have to do some seeking. These annoying quirks happen from the lock screen _  and when using completely open. Doesn't seem to be a pattern. Randomly works _  and randomly fails. Please fix!!! It's so close to being nearly perfect! This is really a really good media player. I started using it on the desktop computer because it was a small file size that played almost any file type you asked it to play. I use it almost exclusively for MP3 files. The thing I love about the app is that you can increase the playing speed in small or large steps (and it adjusts the frequency _  of course _  so your audiobook doesn't sound like chipmunks.) This is a powerful feature! I wish you could fast-forward the file and not accidentally bump it up to play the next file (like every car stereo _  sharing the FF and the NEXT button _  so one little slip of your finger and you will lose your place).,3,11/17/2019,313
App884,org.videolan.vlc,i have always used this as my nr one media player _  but now it is having problems with playing where it left off. everytime i press the play last playlist button _  it plays for a second and then stops. i have to press it fast for a few times for it to work _  but then 2 or 3 minutes later _  it stops completely and i must open my phone to fix it again. ive uninstalled and reinstalled it _  but the problems persist. please do something about it.,1,07/08/2019,1240
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Not a bad app but when you're listening to music videos and you click the option to have it play in audio mode and then you can turn your phone screen off and everything _  when the next song starts it jumps halfway through the song or it'll just go straight to the end so it won't play the next song from the beginning _  it does this to all the songs in the playlist. I've checked the settings and nothing fixes the problem.,1,07/14/2019,109
App884,org.videolan.vlc,It's an app _  and a good one at that. One can watch videos on this app. There are a lot of gestures one can do while watching a video to do different things _  such as seek a certain point in a playing video _  or increase/decrease your device's brightness. Has a night mode. This app can create an index for videos that need one to seek an area in the video _  which came in handy for me once. There's no advertisements _  or features locked behind a paywall. Pretty nice _  overall.,5,08/23/2019,248
App884,org.videolan.vlc,VLC Media player - since the first time I discovered it on PC _  I realized: technically _  it is the best media player around. It plays the fastest _  it is lightweight _  and it never failed me. I use it on my Mac as well. On Android - it is the same thing - technically _  the best. But in terms of user experience - the GUI _  the way it looks and feels - it is inferior. When I want a enjoy music _  it is not the first choice. When I need some media to play either fast _  or stable _  or lightweight - it wins.,4,09/16/2019,235
App884,org.videolan.vlc,So far the app has been working pretty well for me _  my only complaint is that when using chromecast you have to leave the app unlocked or your video will stop playing and you will have to find where you were again. When you leave it unlocked your screen will go black to save battery life and it will turn back on when you touch it _  but even when unlocked it will stop playing sometimes.,4,11/11/2019,15
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Nice app. Has played all my videos thus far. Fast. I do request for the ability to manual zoom in on specific locations of the video. On another video player that has m and an x in the name _  you can 2-finger pinch to zoom in on different parts of your screen and it will zoom in to that specific location. Thank you!,5,09/26/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,There are so many problems: 1. Please allow us rearrange our playlists. 2. Why can't I mark multiple and delete? Please fix it. 3. Why I can't find a whole lot of videos on my device in vlc? These (among others) are the major issues right now _  I'll get back to you soon hopefully. *This is as nice as someone can get _  do understand it is constructive criticism*,1,10/07/2019,177
App884,org.videolan.vlc,VLC is the Only Media Player I use. I Have a PC with a Shared Folder and When I use VLC on my Phone I can see my Shared Folders on my PC from my Phone. I am then able to Play those video and music Files. This is a very Useful Application.,5,12/27/2019,16
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Seriously? Why remove something which was useful? Why only the Sort by tab only has name? Earlier it had duration _  last modified many options also we were able to delete video in VLC. Why remove all those functions?,2,01/07/2020,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,This is a really good universal media player. I like that it allows me to sort music files by artist _  genre _  etc. _  as well as add them to a playlist. The UI is very easy to navigate and it does what I need it to do. My one issue is that only about half my music files are showing up in the Audio screen. When I navigate to the Directory _  I can find and play the files that aren't otherwise visible _  but they are all stored in the same folder on an SD card _  so I'm not sure why some of them don't appear in the Audio screen. It doesn't appear to be a format issue either as nearly all the music files on my card are .mp3s. If anyone has a solution please let me know because otherwise this is the best music/media player I can get on an Android device.,4,11/17/2018,1417
App884,org.videolan.vlc,This app was tunning fine. Within the last 2 days _  the app claims have no media files. The app will stop playing and a pop up message says the media file doesn't exist. Then all of my playlists are empty.,3,01/17/2020,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,There is an update feature where the list of titles in a file scrolls through on each line like a 24-hour news screen. So say I have a file of 10 movies _  all 10 lines move across the screen over and over so I can't just read the titles at a glance like I used to. It's extremely unpleasant to try to sort through _  especially for someone who already has visual processing issues. Other than that _  the app is good. But that new feature is awful and not sure I want to continue using the app.,3,12/05/2019,85
App884,org.videolan.vlc,This update has screwed up the organisation of videos I liked it in tiles but now it is a list and button colors were more milder than they are now and the skip 10 seconds was silent and cool than it is now plssss bring back features of old version Hate the new version,1,12/13/2019,2

App884,org.videolan.vlc,Post-Update: My Huawei smartwatch can no longer see VLC in it's status menu. Edit: I uninstalled _  and installed an older version. Overall pre-update: Its not great for music. It has basic nedia featurew _  like playlists _  but the implementation is messy and unforgiving. i.e making a 25 song playlist _  when you accidently tap a song instead of holding on it to add it _  and VLC wipes your playlist. and makes a new "playlist" of that one song. There is no way to look at the recent playlists _  or undo.,2,04/10/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I had the problem that when I added music the player did not notice and  refreshing did not seem to work. I found out afterwards that refreshing just responds quite slowly _  besides taking quite some time while scanning. One also has to refresh the screen manually. It is  confusing that exiting while playing does not exit _  but continues playing in the background. When opening the background player there seems to be no way of exiting. But it turns out that pressing 'Pause' in fact exits. Besides those issues _  a pretty useful app. I just discovered I can sort all tracks on addition date _  which is what I wanted. I am also happy to be able to point scanning to the one directory I use to put music in.,4,05/11/2019,352
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I used to love vlc. For the most part still do. However _  since upgrading it _  I've lost the ability to sort by filename _  instead all I have is by song title. As a result my albums are playing in the wrong order now _  and it is very irritating. Can you add back the ability to sort by filename please?,3,10/19/2018,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Why you guys make this app complicated after every update _  the app was working fine untill the last update and now the playlist option is shifted to another place _  turning on/off subtitles are too complicated _  the title of the video is missing in video menu as well as in the video _  the last version was good but the update made it too bad to use! Fix it!,1,05/31/2019,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,The latest version has the worst delete function I've seen. Firstly _  you have to select delete twice before the app registers your input. Secondly _  then you have to confirm that you want to delete the item you want to delete. and thirdly _  if you have a video minimised in app _  then you can't delete anything because the minimised bar is overlayed over the option to confirm that you want to delete another video or item. So you have to wait for the video to end. Kindly return it to the old version,2,05/04/2019,5

App884,org.videolan.vlc,VLC is a legend among media players. From the smooth buffering _  to the automatic subtitle matching _  to the built-in playback controls _  to never needing to search and install a codec.

App884,org.videolan.vlc,VLC for Android will not play webradio streams with my Chromecast Audio renderer. It appears to connect. It even displays the artist and song title. No music. Sometimes there's a message saying the stream "cannot be played". But when I disconnect the Chromecast Audio device the stream plays on my phone. I understand that Google has discontinued Chromecast Audio but Spotify and every other app I've downloaded work with it with no problem. Not up to the standard of VLC for Windows by a long shot.,2,05/22/2019,9
App884,org.videolan.vlc,On my phone with verson 3.0.13 _  works great. On my media box with 3.1.4 _  the last two lines on drop down menus or directory listings are invisible. The last two entries are there but not visible on screen. The screen doesn't scoll down far enough to show them but I can tab down to them and select the two off screen choices. Also _  with playing DVD ISO files from network _  3.1.4 has jitters - visible pause as if buffer ran out.,3,05/26/2019,5
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Nothing to complain about. Everything looks good & works fine _  just like the desktop version. However _  if you could grant me two wish _  I would hoping that you could give me an "Extra Small" size subtitle as an option because as of right now _  the small is still kind of big in my 2014 720p display. Also _  Sort by Date feature. Thanks!,5,05/13/2019,83
App884,org.videolan.vlc,VLC is my favourite cross-platform audio and video player. I bought a computer with VLC preloaded _  and I fell in love with it as soon as I launched it. Simple _  customisable and without adverts or a subscription system. Ever since _  VLC has earned the right to be one of the first programs I install on any new device. It does have its flaws _  however. I would ditch all my default programs if only I could edit tags _  sort videos into folders and shuffle songs by a specific artist!,5,02/07/2019,128
App884,org.videolan.vlc,It's great _  except I had to uninstall _  since it absolutely insists on opening and automatically playing the last file opened. If I pause or stop _  it just starts again. Close the app; reopens and starts again. Force close; relaunches again. What a nightmare. I've had malware that was less intrusive.,1,05/26/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,VLC for Android was and is my favourite media player. However v 3.0.13 : Casting from android phone to built-in chromecast of Sony AndroidTV (Android 7.0) doesn't work. Just black tv screen with video title. Unable to start video. Sony recently updated the tv's "Built-In Chromecast" to version 1.36.145507. Still not working _  again the same black screen.

App884,org.videolan.vlc,[I've been] loving the new update for the music player. Very simple to understand and navigate the menu system _  the video player has all the settings you will need _  and runs like an absolute BEAST. My only quarrel is that while it can run high quality video with no issues _  I do sometimes experience frame skips with super high-res webm videos every now and then if they are unprofessionally made.,5,04/15/2019,1010
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I don't even need to go into why this media player is amazing. Fixed my codec issues for playing certain file types _  and no ads??? That's so fhhcking rare now a days for android apps _  they're garbage and full of ads. VLC holds up to their high standard and does not disappoint. You'll find similar apps _  I'm sure _  that probably work well _  too. However they're going to be riddled with intrusive _  malicious ads _  and be a general pain in your rear. Thanks _  VLC! I give credit where credit is due 💚💚💚,5,12/22/2018,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Serious high quality audio reproduction and great video. It appears all known Codecs play. This player has some rough edges on audio though. The music tries to start before the buffer is filled and will gap on initial startup. This needs to be fixed. HD Bluetooth performance is exemplary and very high quality with excellent dynamic range and resolution. My biggest complaint: I can't seem to find ANY method of replacing missing album art from online sources. That took one star off.,4,09/18/2019,148
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Hi! VLC in-app subtitle download has not been working for quite a while. Whenever I try the option the response I get is _  "some error occurred. Please try in few seconds."

App884,org.videolan.vlc,Disgustingly invasive app. It decided to access all my phone call recordings from another app _  and there was no option to prevent this or remove them from VLC. Then I ended up deleting them in the VLC app not knowing that permanently deleted them from my entire phone. So I lost years worth of important phone recordings. Thanks VLC! Why don't you just respect people's privacy?! Permissions should be way more limited. I have uninstalled this horrible app.,1,09/26/2019,1

Since my new phone has much more storage _  I decided to put my music collection on my phone. Being a traditionalist _  I wanted whatever media player I ultimately went with to play only whatever folder I chose and in the order I put them in as if I were listening to that folder on LP. Well _  it's like VLC read my mind _  as they all show up in their proper order. VLC ROCKS!!!,5,11/14/2019,16

App884,org.videolan.vlc,I use it to watch local videos then stream them on a Chromecast. It works but if you leave the app then come back without closing it _  it gets very glitchy and pretty much breaks. You have to shut the app down then reopen it for it to be able to stream on Chromecast again. If you are just watching videos on the phone _  it works perfect. If you leave the app and come back it usually even remembers where you are in the video and starts a few seconds before you paused. This depends on RAM and how many apps you have open.,3,10/07/2018,100
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I so much love the app but I am tired of it actually. Wasn't like this before. It doesn't detect new files even if one refreshes and that's a big turn off... I can't keep uninstalling and installing because I want new files to appear. It's very very annoying.,2,04/07/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,So where is the option to stop autoplay after finish playing 1 video for android tv version? After the update it keep play the next movie. I prefer the old style view of the settings when playing video _  where the option is on the middle not on the right side. Also after I stop watching the video _  I want the screen select that video file back and not selecting back the first video list. It's annoying to scroll back the Playlist.,4,04/11/2019,12
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Best player out there for handling multiple different file extensions. Many standard players do not recognize many common file types _  but i have yet to encounter an audio or video file type that VLC does not accept. The interface is a bit bareboned _  but it does what it does very well. And it's free!!! So no ads!!!,5,12/12/2018,53
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Great application. I use it for PC and Android. A great feature is to watch movies at twice normal speed (or faster _  or slower than normal speed) while having the audio sound normal. i.e. Speech is speeded up or slowed down _  but the frequencies remain the same _  so it sounds normal.,5,04/08/2019,75
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Used to work properly with my 3000+ file music library on Android Pie. After using Android Q Beta for a couple days _  I reinstalled Pie. Now VLC doesn't see any of my media files _  even though File Manager lists them all. The beta debug version does not fix my issue. So VLC is useless to me now. Too bad _  I really prefer VLC over all the other players I've used. Edit: Using the Directories view shows the media in the directory.

App884,org.videolan.vlc,I've been a long-time VLC user and it is still the only video player I'd like installed on my PC. Now I've downloaded it on my Android phone and fell in love with it instantly. The dark theme looks awesome on my screen and I'm really happy it is there. Always the darker the better! I was confused between MX and this app _  and the fact that the former has 500M+ downloads was really making me go for MX _  except for the $6 tag for the Ad-Free version (uhh _  yes im kinda broke hehe *blush*). I haven't tried MX to be honest so I don't know how it compares to VLC but I'm happy with my choice regardless. Thanks to the develolers and contributors behind VideoLan and VLC. Hopefully one day I'll be able to donate _  meanwhile I encourage other users to drop a review and support the guys for their work. Peace!,5,11/25/2018,4
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Never have any problems with this app. In fact _  I find I get more volume without expecting it. It goes from 100% to 200%. Nothing else I've tried does that as this app does. It's great for extra volume and supports many different types of video extensions and music as well. Lots of great features.,5,11/06/2018,2
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Generally love this player but I download long videos and don't watch them all the way through in one shot. I cannot get this version to pick up the video where it left of and resume playing. Always goes back to the start. That's a deal breaker for me.,3,03/21/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,It's decent except for one annoying problem: When i move or delete my movies _  they still appear as thumbnails in VLC _  their location being under storage/emulated/. When i delete them they just reappear _  and refreshing the media library doesn't change it. Please fix this. EDIT: You fixed the problem I had! Thank you. I will change my rating for this app.,4,08/13/2019,42
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Awesome video player _  it can really play every video in the highest quality that I've seen this far _  it is even my top option when it comes up playing any video although it might sometimes have a problem with starting over a video you left watching _  so i suggest them to work on it...,4,04/15/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Despite the fact that VLC is one of the most advanced media players in the field _  your Android dev team has had a real test of wits. Compared to other media players _  of a perceived lower calliber like music player and km player _  i would go for those less placed players anytime _  over vlc. VLC cannot play anything in the background or even beyond locked screen for more than a minute _  meaning that you can only use it without doing anything else with the phone. Review for huawei mate 9 on Android 9,1,05/16/2019,2
App884,org.videolan.vlc,It was a good app since last update. After the update I am facing a lot of problems in listing to music. The app. is getting closed in between a song. I am not even able to listen to one complete song. After 2 mins. its stopping. I reinstalled it thinking the issue will resolve but no use. I you can provide a solution I'll again install it.,1,04/12/2019,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,It would be unfair if I don't say anything about this wonderful app. Although many users have given their positive reviews already but it's of utmost necessity for me to tell the world that this app is indead worth more than just a five stars ✨. The app is absolutely amazing as it's easy to use with many intuitive interfaces for better performance and satisfactory user experience. I recommend it to everyone. You will not regret having it on either your mobile phone or pc 💻. Cheer,5,01/26/2019,3
App884,org.videolan.vlc,VLC player for PC has been the only media player I use for watching movies and listening to music on. This mobile version for smart devices isn't as good as the version for PC. It's a great version regardless. If you're looking for a good media player that plays pretty much any format for your mobile device then I recommend getting this one. VLC is well optimized and won't hog your memory,5,10/03/2018,5
App884,org.videolan.vlc,The program will often forget that there are music files (video or mpg) on the sd card. Or _  if you delete music files using the phone _  VLC will still retain the song title but not the actual song. Therefore populating the music list with deleted song titles. I cannot delete files using VLC. Installing VLC media player you get to auto or manually seek music within your phone. Manual scan said I had 43 files. Select folder. Now reports I have none. Otherwise works well.,3,04/30/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Thought I'd found the perfect music app until I tried playing a song _  and that's all it did. Played the song! The only way to listen to a series of songs is to make a play list or start from track 1 and listen to everything else in order. I want to listen to album 3 of 7 but it won't let you.,2,12/16/2018,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,VLC..... Really needs Serious Update...!!! Problems I faced with Vlc... 1. No Folder wise separation  _  videos gets totally mixed up and looks too much messy so This is the main reason people use MX Player over this application. 2. Lack of customisation _  you should provide some customisation options  _ so people can customise the application according to their taste. 3. No proper support to the all video formats (Major issue for Me) I saw most of the times audio is playing and picture is stoped at one place or get delayed and vice versa. 4. Scanning every time after opening app is annoying and sometimes frustrating to me . Coz after full scanning this app is not capable to play movies smoothly which Mx player does really very well. Those are my main issues with this application _  I hope upcoming updates will solve this all problems _  issues as soon as possible. Thank You.,3,11/07/2018,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,untill the latest update i loved this app. however the newest update has some annoying problems. like the newly downloaded shows saying they have been watched or makeing me click ok on 2 parts of the screen to delete something (if i press delete that means i want it gone. especially since i have to scroll down to the delete option. also videos have had the wrong thumbnail. but other than that l love it (hence 4 stars) also how do i go back to a old version? the new one is annoying,4,04/15/2019,28
App884,org.videolan.vlc,This app WAS great _  but the new update is awful. My videos are in separate folders in my phone _  and VLC USED to group them all on one page for playlist-style viewing _  but now they don't. I can put vids all together on an actual playlist _  but they can't be manually reordered within it. Secondly _  they've removed the "sort by date" feature _  which I need to play my videos sequentially. VLC has removed the only 2 things that made this app useful to me. Can't recommend. Uninstall.,1,04/08/2019,588
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Used to love VLC 5* but it's a headache _  can't find out how to lock controls on to the screen _  such as pause _  why does pause have to be 2 touches away! Explaining this to passengers while driving is dangerous _  but it needs to be paused _  stopped _  or volume down! Instantly. Doesn't stay playing when kids accidentally hit the home key _  makes driving so stressful. Just for trying to listen to a play list! Oh and can't appear to shuffle after selecting a single item to play. Very inefficient. Pls fix.,1,06/08/2019,40
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Great Music Player. As i only really use the music player on this app i shall only review that _  which is 1st class. I became familiar with VLC through PC usage and decided to give this a try for my phone as the music player that comes with it has no EQ _  I have been using it for a few months now and not once has it let me down. For a start there are no adds _  there is the ability to create your own playlists and has an EQ with multiple pre- sets or the ability to create your own. Worth getting,5,09/14/2019,178
App884,org.videolan.vlc,There's no way to give the VLC devs enough praise. There is no one-does-all app for media but none come anywhere nearly as close as this one _  especially the PC app. It's not a quick-and-dirty media player _  so don't expect it to perform like greased lightning on cheap _  5 year-old hardware (this is where 90% of your critical reviews come from for most apps). Just download it. There's no way you won't find a good use for it. No nags _  no ads _  no downside. 10-star project.,5,10/01/2019,130
App884,org.videolan.vlc,It doesn't support Chromecast _ which is a very important function on Android phones _  and it shouldn't have been overlooked. Also _  the controls are not quite optimal. l have been using VLC on PCs for many years _  and l commend it for being part of the open source environment _  same on Android as well _  but Chromecast function is a must.,3,06/29/2019,18
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Great but with some playback problems. the playback feature skips ahead about 30 minutes when listening to audio books. It also does not take title info from the name of the files _  and causes issues with the order of files. The issue can be fixed by making a playlist but i think there is somesort of disconnect between playlists and audio section which may be the root of the playback issue.,4,07/08/2019,71
App884,org.videolan.vlc,VLC has always done everything I have ever needed it to do. I like the media controls and that it shows videos in true fullscreen without the home and back buttons visible. I love the range of file support and the way it organizes files makes it easy to separate seasons of shows if you name them right. All in all i love this app for all media and will continue to use it. Great job guys and thanks for the security patch _  I reinstalled after the patch was released.,5,08/09/2019,1566
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Absolutely shocking! The app accessed some of the videos on my phone I didn't want it to so I deleted them individually on the app only to find it had them deleted them off my phone as well! Videos of my newborn are now lost forever because of this. There is no where in the settings of the app that states this happens or an option to turn this function off.,1,10/25/2019,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,This is sad _  VLC used to be excellent _  but it can no longer handle even 720p .mkv files without crashing or losing audio when seeking (it was so bad I wasted an hour rechecking the files etc _  surely they were corrupt or something). Not a few months ago I was watching 1080p .mkv files without issues. I have No idea what they did _  I've tried messing with different settings to no avail. The cringiest part is the built-in _  'crappy' media player that comes with Android handles the task just fine. Oof,2,08/02/2019,116
App884,org.videolan.vlc,VLC is my favorite desktop player but using the version here for Android is like walking on eggshells. Crashes and burns when playing all of the time on Android 8.1.0 _  disabling functionality of everything else while it is frozen. Not worth it. The two stars I am giving it are because it is still versatile when not crashed and if it works for you _  great. Too much hassle for me. Hope they improve it.,2,08/14/2019,44
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Following the most recent update _  VLC Refresh seems to populate screens by Artist _  instead of by Album Artist _  even when this option is not selected in Settings. Also _  when an Artist is selected _  then Albums always seem to be sorted by Year by default _  instead of by Name _  which is a more sensible default. If one changes the sort order to be by Name _  then this selection is not remembered. This is very frustrating to use _  when one is trying to simply play a chosen Album by a chosen Artist!,3,08/25/2019,50
App884,org.videolan.vlc,This is d best video player after mx player. I love d PIP feature _  it's nice. D UI is nice but there's no theme feature. However _  I notice some glitches with d app:Sometimes it takes a bit of time to play video in PIP mode _  it's unstable. Plus _  it doesn't play subtitle file in some videos. My suggestion: videos to be sorted by time added _ d media button should be set to play last played video not first video _  a button to quickly switch to PIP mode is better than d screen orientation button. Thanks,4,08/20/2019,15
App884,org.videolan.vlc,The VLC player is a charm to use and could be used for the videos that aren't even supported on MX Player. It is really satisfying to use this to watch videos and listen audios. I would rate it 4 out of 5. The only one star I didn't give is for the reason that there is no on screen volume control for the audio songs which I found very disappointing. Please developers _  introduce an on screen volume control option for audios just like there is one for videos. Thanks.,4,11/03/2019,81
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Gets the job done way better than built-in players _  like the variable speed. Moved to a different player recently because it never remembers my place when listening to a long file _  no skip ahead/back within a file _  and hard to precisely position playback in a long file like an audio book. Also _  haven't found a way to re order playlists or export them so I can edit them with something else. Would be good if it had the ability to edit metadata _  rename _  and move file path all in one place.,3,09/22/2019,267
App884,org.videolan.vlc,It's really nice overall _  though some bugs still occur: •The screen goes gray sometimes while playing a video. •When playing audio _  it stops after a few seconds _  then it continues playing. Also _  these are some functions I'd really appreciate: •Frame by frame. •Screenshot. Hope you're giving this a read. Thanks!,4,09/26/2019,84
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Audio MP3s are constantly cutting out _  like the audio "plays too fast" for the app. Using MediaMonkey until this is fixed.,2,12/08/2019,0

App884,org.videolan.vlc,Please provide playback speed in small pop-up box which will be always displayed during playback as it happens in MX PLAYER. This feature is good.,4,12/09/2019,4
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Best media player app i have ever used Nothing less then⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐,5,01/19/2020,2
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Very much appreciable for very High Resolution videos but sometimes _  video just stops playing and the apps crashes for no reason... But Whatever! Great Nonetheless.,5,01/18/2020,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,It is a great video player for laptops and computers but some features are missing in the Android version. 1. Can't rename media files like MxPlayer. 2. Can't sort media by date. 3. Doesn't display file size. Overall MxPlayer has more features but free version contain ads _  for better experience pro is better option. For window an Linux _  VLC is my preferred player.,3,11/08/2019,20
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Excellent app _  but one problem. The volume controls seem a bit strange to me _  since there's no option to change the percentage amount for when adjusting the volume. For instance _  increasing or decreasing the volume by 10% _  5% _  2% or even 1% to give the user more control over the audio. This is something I would love to see in this already amazing app.,4,11/07/2019,32
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Plays stuff meant for iTunes so I don't have to exclusively deal with stuck up Apple. It's probably one of the best things you can say about any player,5,01/04/2020,2
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I've just downloaded it and could see how good it works. Congrats _  VLC Team.,5,02/19/2020,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Without a doubt VLC is the BEST media platform available for any OS: Android _  Apple _  PC _  Linux.. this player far outperforms any other media app on the market. The design of this player gives you COMPLETE control over your media playback while still maintaining a VERY simplistic and stylish user interface. For over a decade VLC has been my go-to app when playing any media type-- I STRONGLY recommend trying this out for yourself!,5,11/28/2019,11

App884,org.videolan.vlc,Why did you break it?? Where is the eq control _  or the preamp? I sure can't find 'em - they're not where they used to be! VLC is the standard we compare any other media apps to... Why did you break it??,2,12/21/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,This app was phenominaly good now with the latest update its just annoying. Cant play m4b files to vlc from my storage. Most files dont show and I have to go to directories yo find them. Its just a pain.,2,12/25/2019,4
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Used to start video from where you left off... After update _  not anymore! 1 step forward 2 steps back!... Been using vlc for years _  might have to change if not fixed.... (edit) Uninstalled!,1,01/24/2020,0

App884,org.videolan.vlc,I switched from Rocket Player Premium _  because the app constantly started breaking with recent updates. This player has the same issue _  but it's worse. With JRT's player _  it would destroy the database after a couple hours of playing then take five hours to rebuild. With VLC _  it rebuilds after the entire app is closed. Sometimes switching back to VLC after playing a 15 second YouTube video destroys the database and i have to force close the app in Settings for it to actually rebuild again.,2,01/14/2019,2
App884,org.videolan.vlc,The update before the this last update I think messed with the app. for about maybe a week or so I didnt see anything wrong _  but two days ago it made all the video picture previews become the same picture. there are still a few with the correct preview picture but the majority of them are the same picture. already tried deleting the data and resyncing my videos but it didn't fix anything. plz fix cuz you're the only player 8 like on Android.,4,04/11/2019,17
App884,org.videolan.vlc,With this new update _  every time I play a video the audio gets a little out of sync on its own and I have found a way to fix that. It's very annoying and completely destroys the user experience when consuming media. The same video plays fine without the audio sync problem on other applications on the same device. Pls fix this ASAP.,1,11/24/2018,15
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Doesn't work well with subtitles. There have been multiple occasions where the subtitles wouldn't show even with all the correct settings _  and I had to close and reopen the app 10 times before they'd finally appear. Switched to MX Player.,3,11/13/2018,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Why? Why the new update?!!? It's so limiting now!! Instead of rewinding to the begining of the song and exiting out easily _  i have to go back in the app and find out how I'm supposed to turn off the music!!! And the layout for the music tracks and stuff is AWFUL!!!! I can't find the equalizer anymore and playing audio while phone is turned off is a pain in the ass now!! Plz fix this since its unbearable to deal with. The update was admittingly a HUGE letdown.,1,04/20/2019,28
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Defaults for video rotation and hiding fast foward button are stupid _  as well as the lack of option to sort music by date modified to see latest additions. But other than that this works with tons of options _  no stability issues like G Play Music. Frustratingly sort preferences reset everytime _  and the app closes shortly after you pause music when others don't. I really wish VLC didn't have such a bad UI cause it'd be great otherwise.,3,02/17/2019,2
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Excellent app. Even sorts out series videos into chronological order. Previous app (player xtreme) played video with no sound. Brilliant playback and has an equaliser so I can get the best sound out of my Huawei Honor 9. It also helps that the Honor 9 has a better-than-full HD screen. Highly recommended.,5,09/12/2018,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I used to love this app for listening to saved podcasts etc. _  however since the update the resume button has been removed. This used to let me play directly from where I left off _  but now I have to go through the history to find the episode and guess a time to continue from. Will be looking for alternatives.,1,04/16/2019,60
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Best Video app ever. VLC has a long history for producing & are constantly improving a great app. They don't allow 3rd party's to advertise in any way. Instead they have always been a group of individuals writing apps to impress other individuals. They way things were meant to be when the internet was created over 30 years ago. They provided the best media apps then & have only improved since then.,5,04/13/2019,166
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Love the pc version _  and this is a good player for free _  but the interface is really not intuitive. I will probably stop using it because I can't fast forward _  items I'm playing disappear from the interface and other frustrations. I'm really surprised how difficult it is to use,2,09/16/2018,6
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Undeniably excellent application which I've used for many years but it now seems to be getting a bit heavy or not tested too well on older devices. Despite maxing the acceleration on mine _  it's stuttering enough that I've had to install alternatives which play the same audio files without issue.,3,04/14/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,This is a great app for watching movies. The brightness and volume controls on the screen itself is a very smart thing without having to slide down the notification bar.

App884,org.videolan.vlc,My mediaplayer for the longest time now. Recently switched to a HTC 10/ Android 8.0.0. I encountered a few bugs with the audio interface. All of my music is on my SD card _  plus thumbnail images in almost every album. VLC doesn't show all artists in the music interface _  although I can navigate into the respective folders via the dictionary function. The thumbnail detection doesn't work for all of the albums. After clearing the database and running a new datascan VLC doesn't detect the same albums.,3,12/31/2018,3
App884,org.videolan.vlc,last update just broke the app. 90% of my music doesn't show up and of the 10% that does show up _  only 5% plays while the rest just doesn't respond when I try to play it. Tried another player and it worked so the files aren't corrupt and it's not my phone. Time to uninstall until they fix this train wreck of an "update".,1,04/30/2019,10
App884,org.videolan.vlc,DO NOT USE THIS APP. When i pause music and even video _  i go to resume a few minutes later and the app will close. i then have to reopen and start playing the song or video and it doesn't keep it's place so I'm can never pause music or movies without restarting the app and my place in the music or movie in which i was playing. uninstalling this annoying app!!!!,1,04/16/2019,17
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Used to be a good video player until the latest update. The new UI is not too bad _  but when I want to play a video as audio whenever it is left will be automatically continued to where the last time I left it. If possible _  change how playing videos as audio to what it used to be or just bring old updatee back.,1,04/13/2019,42
App884,org.videolan.vlc,While I'm not sure how extensive the features are on the VLC _  but I do know it is the best video player I've ever used - and it's FREE! Onscreen controls for brightness _  volume and ff/rw; no fumbling device/program searches which trip up or stop the video play just to stop/pause _  raise/lower volume or screen brightness. Too bad Bezos can't spare a few dollars off his trillion dollar company to write a program for his Prime Video player. VLC puts Amazon to shame.,5,02/15/2019,15
App884,org.videolan.vlc,love that it has no commercials but hate that it didnt show a song i put on my memory card on my phone. i also hate that it doesnt play all the songs on the memory card in alphabetical order but will when u hit the shuffle icon. if y'all can fix that _  I'll up the rating to 5 stars.,3,03/07/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,No longer allows me to cast to my TV.... it used to do it. I don't know what changed. I know it's the app and not the device because other apps continue to cast _  this is the only one that has stopped casting to my google device attached to the TV.,1,02/23/2019,4
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Great app thank you. I now have a Huawei p smart 2019 and the player that came with it is a real pain as it doesn't play anything from Microsoft media player _  must the the format type. I installed this and in moments it plays everything on my phone. I'm one happy bunny! Thanks again.,5,03/19/2019,2
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I've been using this app for years now and have always forgotten to give it a review. I've gone through several phones and this is always a must-have download. I've been using it for so long I've forgotten what makes it unique but it's a significantly versatile video player that's easy to use. I especially love the upgrade that allows us to now download subtitles. Honestly _  I'm to point where I've developed an aversion for using any other video player that's not VLC on Android or PC.,5,03/23/2019,1947
App884,org.videolan.vlc,The new update is not good. As a long time user (5 Years) _  this has got to be the worst update. The fact that its longer to refresh if there's a new video _  or sometimes cant refresh in general its a letdown. I wont be using this App until the new update comes out or at least just downgrade it _  the old one is way better.,1,04/09/2019,79
App884,org.videolan.vlc,It's pretty unreliable _  playlists randomly vanish as did the playlists link?? I spent hours adding specific tracks to a myriad of playlists and for a whole 5 hr drive I had them _  then on the return: not even a playlist option is there?? Ironically almost all of the mkv videos are sound/video phase distorted and seem to be very 'jerky'.. All in all _  along with the pretty awful recent VLC for windows update I believe VideoLan is on a downward spiral. Sad really previously it was the must have tool!,2,04/10/2019,3
App884,org.videolan.vlc,over all this one is the best video player for android it plays any format you throw at it and the biggest benefit is its free and no ads!! just a small but very useful feature is missing in this player. MULTI-TRACK AUDIO to choose the audio to play over the video.,5,03/28/2019,11
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I changed the file names of my shows I want to watch and VLC player uses some other title unrecognisable to me and proceeds to play all my shows in a completely random order _  it also doesn't save where I'm up to correctly and I have to spend time finding where I left off _  the equaliser volume booster is good though,3,10/01/2018,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Auto scan is not working properly _  it is showing videos it scanned for the first time. I moved a video from it's location and the new directory of the video wasn't updated. When I added new videos to the devices _  inorder to view them I have to visit the appropriate directory from the directories tab in menu section. it's taking so much time for scanning videos in my device. I hope you might fix these in the next update.,4,06/06/2019,112
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Andoid ver. used to be really good _  but now it has annoying glitches. I can no longer choose between ext. & Int. SD _  All Folders & Playlists it displays as "Unknown" (though it scanned all storage for music!) The ONLY way to find songs is alphabetically. The controls DISAPPEAR when playing a song. I can no longer choose: Folder/Playlist _  Repeat song _  Repeat all (in folder/playlist) _  pause _  stop _  play. And to Stop _  I MUST REBOOT PHONE!!! Please fix!!! (Android 8 Oreo _  Galaxy S8 a),1,06/06/2019,7
App884,org.videolan.vlc,the PC version sets a pretty high standard for being minimal and unintrusive _  but this app starts every video with swipe gesture instructions that hover over the video until you tap "dismiss this"... i appreciate having instructions but why i need to be instructed EVERY SINGLE TIME I PLAY A NEW FILE is itself beyond comprehension and lazy app development.,1,09/02/2019,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,VLC is a great app except for one very critical thing. Even when fully closed _  it will take control from other apps (that were previously playing) of playing music over Bluetooth on an auto-reconnect of device. Also _  even when fully closed _  it will start playing over Bluetooth on an auto-reconnect when nothing was previously playing. Stealing control is bad enough _  but starting play when didn't want any app playing is much worse. Fix this issue and 5 star rating.,2,09/14/2019,59
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I have been using MX player from the beginning of my transition to smartphone _  which was good at the beginning. Now a days lots of advertisment are creeping in _  which is irritative. So I was looking for other media players and found this. Believe me _  it's much better than MX. 1. Simple design 2. Ease of use - volume _  brightness _  scrolling videos 3. Play all most sort of formats even plays 5.1 audio,5,09/13/2019,92
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I use a file browsing app to connect to my server and nas. It connects fine _  after I allowed the nas to use SMB version 2 and up. VLC however shows only the public folders but fails accepting the SMB credentials. Whatever format I use _  VLC shows: SMB authentication required". This happened in previous versions _  at least a year ago _  too _  why hasn't this been fixed already?,2,06/15/2019,21
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Hey it's VLC. If I had a toaster it could be installed on I would. It's playlist organization is pretty miserable _  but that's not it's strength. As with the PC version _  if it's a media file _  even an obscure format _  VLC will likely play it. It's one of those go-to apps that really belongs on any device that can play media files.,5,10/11/2019,133
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I love the Chromecast option in this app I use it to stream my files to my TV and I love that it saves where I left off but it has a bunch of bugs on the android app. 1. Subtitles don't work on Chromecast. 2. When my phone locks then I unlock it the app stops the video then restarts it. This adds like 10 seconds of black screen in middle of my video for no reason. Otherwise a great app. The pause/rewind is intuitive and the ability to download subtitles was a nice surprise.,4,07/23/2019,37
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I've using this since 2008 on my laptop. I really love this app _  but since I update this app (cellphone) few days ago. I'm kinda little bit of disappointed. when you scroll down or up the list (slow motion) _  interface (trash) and settings (too far away from old one). tsk!,1,07/10/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I have been using this app for over nine months but had to uninstall it as it failed to update my video and audio list after several attempts at refreshing playlist and updating app. Though it can add new audio and video files automatically when parsing media _  it always fails to remove files that have been deleted from phone storage.,1,07/16/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,works like a charm. i absolutely love the internet streaming function that comes along with the app. The SD card/ media scanning stuff is kinda iffy though because it thinks some of my other 'non-video file format' ISO files to be videos. i guess i can't complain too much because everything is more or less working very well so far.,3,08/07/2019,59
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Minimal and relative user friendly GUI _  stable app. However _  several major flaws in the GUI: - often cannot continue where I left off _  especially when headphones are disconnected or playing stops by external reasons - if this happens _  I need to choose the entire playlist and manually skip the needed tracks _  not a single track - for long song names _  you can't see their entire names in the normal playlist - you can't see looking at the playlist at first sight _  which song is actually being played,3,08/03/2019,28
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Loyal to this app for quite some time _  but ever since the last update _  the screen dims and brightens for no reason at all without the percentage of brightness changing. It only happens on this app tho _  so i think its not my phone _  and when the brightening and dimming happens _  my top window isn't affected. Just the app. Hope I get help. Thanks to the developers 😁 Edit: it seems like the app gets confused at times whther to follow the brightness I set in the app or follow the system brightness.,4,09/25/2019,49
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Hi VLC developers; . I love your app _  on my PC and my phone's. But lately _  since the last update _  VLC got worse for the mobile version. It can not arrange media files by date _  or type _  some of the 'on-screen' functions do not work properly unless you rotate the screen _  and the much worse is that VLC suddenly stops working/playing _  especially when playing long sound media _  more than one hour. Also _  the program notification menu on the lock screen is poor without the played media library. Thanks,3,10/09/2019,69
App884,org.videolan.vlc,This app always seems to stop working. Always has done for years. Just rubbish really and annoying. Works well to start with then boom nothing. Not using it again ever.,1,12/09/2019,7

App884,org.videolan.vlc,Best multimedia player for Android. Lots of features that are really useful _  no bloat and no adware. 6 out of 5 stars!,5,01/05/2020,3
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Good but has a few issues. First _  it's doesn't adapt well to network changes - it'll stop midstream and never recover if you go from Wi-Fi to LTE so you constantly need to reload the streaming URL. If VLC was smart enough to recover as soon as a connection was available it'd be great. Second _  it doesn't handle stream metadata well - it'll display artist and song title _  the say unknown artist and unknown song. Once these issues are addressed this will be a solid streaming app.,3,01/09/2019,643
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Please if you have an old version of VLC dont update it. This new update is unbelievable gosh! You can't resume a video after leaving it for few seconds _  lets say while seeing a movie you got an sms _  slide to your inbox to check and then come back to VLC _  it hangs and until youu close it and start the movie afresh _  it remains so! This is annoying!!,1,04/19/2019,33
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Doesn't support 2160p(4k) videos. I mean the video stops for a while and the sound goes on _  after 10-15 seconds the video brings the ongoing scene.,1,02/24/2020,1

App884,org.videolan.vlc,I've noticed in the past a subtle amount of wow when say _  listening to music through the VLC app. I'm not sure if the problem exists _  but I think I can still hear a small and probably unnoticeable amount of pitch and speed instability.,3,03/27/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Full of bugs. After the the time sleeper turns the app off _  it won't play anything more without closing the app from the app settings. Also _  it runs continously on the background even after closed (whether with sleep timer or by any other means) . Can't swipe it off from the notification scroll down bar _  and keeps consuming battery.,2,06/05/2019,4
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Playing ts files other the network does not show full time of the file. Just 00:00 at the end.

After changing audio stream - video and audio gets out of sync. Also with new update vlc does not ask to resume video but plays from the start. UNINSTALLED! Switched to KODI.,1,04/09/2019,2
App884,org.videolan.vlc,this app hasn't been updated in about a year! Definitely needs updated codex and Bug fixes related to audio playback.

App884,org.videolan.vlc,always loved vlc on all devices _  pc and mac. used it on all my android phones _  however on my huawei mate when i close my phone the muskc plays in the background for about 15 seconds then pauses automatically? never had this issue _  i made sure all pernissions were set correctly and to allow it to run in background ect. is this a bug or is it my phone model?,3,04/13/2019,20
App884,org.videolan.vlc,2 previous upgrades ago _  VLC player would automatically detect new music files added. Now it doesn't even try to do that. It just needs to clear up a couple more bugs then it would be great! 23 Feb 2019 update...it still has the same problem,2,02/23/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,often vlc shows just random numbers instead of the file title: for ex 11235 _  etc Can this be changed _  so I always see the actual file name? Also when playing audio straight by clicking an mp3 file for ex _  the vlc interface doesn't appear at all. The thing just starts playing and I have to click the vlc icon _  for the interface to appear with controls _  etc. Is there a way to have it small for ex _  on the top of the screen _  when you play an audio file _  like many other apps appear? thank you.,4,01/20/2019,2
App884,org.videolan.vlc,By default it does not go to landscape mode while playing videos. So most of the times it annoys me by changing from one to other while playing video.

App884,org.videolan.vlc,People are complaining about music playing capabilities!! Download Power Amp as it's an actual music player i use VLC for video playback & Power Amp for music or MX player for video & music as it's been well developed for both as for VLC player very good for free but u get what you pay for i pay for my apps so have the right to complain when they don't work but if you download free apps be greatful & they put ads in free apps to pay for there program because how else can they make money!!,5,02/16/2019,3
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Great app _  turned into a headache after Android 9.0 rollout. Or after the latest app update. Don't know why but now it just abruptly shuts down. Can't listen to a whole song because of this. It's nothing to do with the lock screen or anything. It's just terminating itself.,2,10/08/2018,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Great music player with a few hiccups when loading a large music library. My reason for using VLC is Google Play Music's somewhat retarded way of reading and partially ignoring tags. VLC doesn't have this issue and doesn't tell me to pay for a subscription that I'm never gonna use because I still buy CDs and digitize them. The ony problem with VLC is the app's weakened stability when loading 28 gigs of music. EDIT 3 It hasn't crashed a single time since the last update!,5,06/07/2019,143
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Doesn't work with bittorrent. When I'm launching downloaded tv episode (mkv 1080p) from BitTorrent _  it's playing normally. But then _  if I switch between the open apps (or if I just minimize then maximize vlc app) _  it's sometimes impossible to restore vlc window. I mean vlc app just appears on the screen for a second and disappears. Moreover _  if I try in such situation to reopen the video file from bittorrent _  it doesnt help _  again that flickering of vlc app.,2,10/21/2018,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Plays all my music of all formats. Used this app for more than 2 years. It just works and I can use it to play music on my Bluetooth Bose speakers. Shuffle and playlist functions I enjoy. Wish there was an easy way to import playlists when switching or resetting devices. Playlist function doesn't let me subtract music. Be sure you want that song on the playlist _  or an hour or more may have been wasted when the wrong song was added.,5,11/19/2018,15

App884,org.videolan.vlc,You cant pause when you get a phone call whioe casting _  if you do the video won't pause. In the case that it does pause after you take the call _  it will then cut out the volume. THEN if you try to close the app it won't stop casting.....AT ALL. I had to unplug my Chromecast in order to make it stop playing the volume-less video that was still being played on my tv. GYST!,1,02/02/2019,2
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I used to really like this app. For some reason now _  my videos are unplayable due to it skipping and lagging all the time. The horrible PC app does this as well. Going to stick to MX player _  at least I can change subtitle/audio tracks on that _  too. Unlike this.,1,03/24/2019,2
App884,org.videolan.vlc,VLC has always been my choice on pc and is a fine video player. the android app _  however has been consistently crashing on this LGG6 whenever I put it in the background even for a moment and while there is no other app running _  making it frustrating when returning to it _  has I have to reopen it and find where I left off to answer a text etc...,3,04/16/2019,30
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Entirely improved w/recent update. Used to need to uninstall/reinstall every other day or it kept saying I had no media (even while it was playing something). That problem is gone. Can't reorder playlists at all but this is the only Android player that works for all my music. Take what you can get. It's free & not full of ads. I'd gladly pay a small annual fee or something for a better design & ability to edit playlists _  but that doesn't seem to exist.,3,07/20/2019,1624
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Its a great app _  no doubt but I have an issue or lemme say I have some stuffs that's always happening in which I don't like. 1. Once I minimize my VLC in which I was using to watch a movie to attend to another app and I end up going back to it _  VLC just stops and makes me start my movie all over again. 2. Why does the app just stop just like that all of a sudden after I've opened it if it's gets minimized? BTW I use an Infinix Note 4 Pro,3,05/01/2019,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I have been using VLC for awhile and liked it but since the last update I have issues with it. I can't start playing the songs consecutively from any where on my list any more. when I press play all from any song it jumps back to the beginning. for this reason alone I will not be using it anymore.,2,04/23/2019,43
App884,org.videolan.vlc,several downgrades to old version. sound outage when pausing and resuming video. audio always resets back to 100 when over 100. power button pressing two times while video is running shows unresponsive ui _  instead of pausing and resuming video. audio volume setting is delayed. delete needs confirmation again instead of undo.,4,05/23/2019,3
App884,org.videolan.vlc,This was always my first choice for playing videos. But recently I've been facing issues with it. The subtitles are not shown properly now _  they are stretched out and disoriented frequently. Also _  the subtitle delay function needs to be a little more easy to use. This is a major pullback for me and I'm now looking for a good replacement.,3,11/21/2018,23
App884,org.videolan.vlc,When I pause a video in Vlc _  switch tabs and then go back to vlc almost all the time the app freezes _  the audio is never in sync with a video file _  I have to adjust the audio sync even though no other video app does this. if the issues i wrote down were fixed this app would be perfect. I enjoy using VLC on windows _  it's a shame the android version isnt good. I'm on galaxy s10 plus.,1,06/08/2019,44
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Newly added music files aren't shown when I select the "refresh" option. They sometimes show up when I set "sort by" to "recently added" _  but this needs to be done at least twice to have any effect. Also _  it would be nice to have a feature to edit the song data _  like title _  artist _  etc.,3,05/31/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Not like the PC version at all. Can't get it to shuffle _  repeat _  play audio in the background _  nor will it play if the screen goes off for any reason. This is a definite uninstall for me. My Note 3 _  running Pie _  has the factory book style cover. If I close that (same as turning the display off) VLC stops playing. Not good at all for listening to music.,1,09/23/2019,176
App884,org.videolan.vlc,The fact that VLC seems to be the only pixel 3 compatible player that has PiP that can be resized means it deserves a high rating. That said it would be nice if the feature itself was a bit easier to find and a bit smoother to use. Its a little difficult to find the right size when it doesnt change until you let go of the screen.,4,09/27/2019,37
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Hands down the best Audio/Video Player for Android. I've used the PC/Windows version of VLC for years and it dominates anything out there and is completely freeware with zero ads. The Android version does not have nearly as many options as the PC but this could be limitations of the device and/or operating platform. Great work from volunteer contributors worldwide. Awsome stuff THANK YOU!!,5,07/24/2019,37

App884,org.videolan.vlc,Just works well _  many options like playing video as audio _  picture in picture mode _  streaming to chromecast _  instantly download subtitles _  set audio delay _  sleep timer _  you name it! Supports many different file types _  very reliable _  easy seeking _  audio and brightness controls _  couldn't be better.,5,07/14/2019,13
App884,org.videolan.vlc,this app really great especially when u download a video that needs a subtitle. the only thing wrong is the subtitle _  when downloaded its not been arranged correctly with movie your watching _  at first it will be ok but later it will be faster the movie _  thats the only problem. but still i will give you four star because u did a great job arrange need,4,07/15/2019,17
App884,org.videolan.vlc,It's amazingly difficult to figure out the interface. I enabled "audio only" for videos _  now I can't figure out how to get video back. Shuffling videos means I have to Play All from the first video _  then visually *deselect* Shuffle from the menu _  of which there's like five menu dropdowns available. You can double the volume of videos _  but seemingly not when in audio mode. Half your actions seem to result in starting over from the first episode.,2,08/07/2019,27
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I've been using VLC since 2011 on my PC then I have continued using it in 2015 on Android OS. I was quite satisfied. Since May 2019 - Today _  I haven't been able to play songs to finish. The app pauses the tracks then I'll have to resume. All of this happened after I have updated it on my Nokia 5. Guys please look into it.,1,08/25/2019,56
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Great video/music player but with issues. For some reason _  streaming to a TV _  the subtitles quit after about 2 lines. Super duper annoying. Also for some reason it has issues working properly with Google Chrome. If those are resolved _  then its still the best there is _  but those issues take it down a few notches.,2,08/18/2019,45
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Edit: Midi support was removed ☹️ Previous: I love the player for it supports everything! As opposed to the desktop version _  this one even supports Midi playback. One part I noticed that can improve is _  though there is a support for PiP mode _  I would like an option to automatically switch to background play when I turn off or lock the screen. Currently _  I need to make this selection manually.,5,04/13/2019,550
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Overall the best player _  but since the update it doesnt pack the videos into folders and they moved the resize button one click away which gives a bit of a uncomfort,4,12/08/2019,5

App884,org.videolan.vlc,Works well yet needs to be uninstalled then reinstalled for unknown reasons. Audio performace deminishes _  freeze ups also occur no doubt by way of corruption coming into the app by way of google.,5,12/10/2019,8

App884,org.videolan.vlc,Vlc is my favourite player in case of pc but its sucks while on phone.. UI is not good.. Videos are grouped from all sources in the UI and that is the main and only reason i hated it.. Its should be foldered as such in the source folder. Check MX player for instance. But one thing i must say it can play any video _  may be its UI sucks but its a very powerful player and video supports unbeatable.. Only lack is the UI and folder option..,2,11/17/2019,0

We don't want to click 5 times just for this feature.,3,12/04/2019,110

App884,org.videolan.vlc,While there are a lot of good things going for vlc as a media player _  I can't stand the fact that my audio samples keep getting chopped off at the end during playback. I cut audio for a podcast _  and this is not only an unacceptable feature _  they haven't fixed this issue in over 10 years. Thankfully I have other media players to use as an alternative.,2,12/05/2019,283
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Recent update has been a disaster video photograph disappears next to the file details leaving a empty gray outline have uninstalled the application and will not reinstall until issue has been resolved,4,12/11/2019,4
App884,org.videolan.vlc,My favorite player _  only downfall is the lack of AAC 7 channel support. I have to switch to mx player pro when I have a film with AAC 7 channel audio. Mx Player plays this audio perfect,4,12/11/2019,13
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I don't understand why I'll download this app 24mb and in a few days I check to notice that it's occupying 600mb... Why?!,1,03/06/2020,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I miss the old version  _  background screen mirroring option no more available ?? Please bring back External screen cast options . Thanks,3,12/26/2019,1

App884,org.videolan.vlc,Was a good app for music _  video _  etc. However _  with the latest update _  certain features no longer work. Specifically _  for me _  the sleep timer doesn't work and not all my audio media is recognised. Both of these features used to work fine.,2,04/14/2019,24
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Works great as it's Desktop counterpart & the gesture controls are great but it take a whole lot of screen space _  that to bang in the middle of the screen when using gesture controls. I wish it would just show minimal info at their respective sides in the form of sliders rather than taking a big chunk of screen space which is quite annoying while watching videos! Using it as secondary app just for the same reason.,3,12/16/2018,9
App884,org.videolan.vlc,dont like how i cant set the arrangement once and it stays  _ have to pick my prefered way to sort my videos every single time and videos already deleted still appear sometimes as 2 files  _  its extremely annoying something has to be done about that because vlc is an amazing app little things like these should be a long lasting problem coz its fixable,3,05/13/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Leagues more efficient than Google Play Music. This application is the sams program I choose to use across all my devices _  and for good reason. It isn't intrusive like the Google Play Music and doesn't have the glitches either. Kudos VLC! I've been a huge fan for a while now _  and the only thing you've failed at is disappointing.,5,12/30/2018,25
App884,org.videolan.vlc,VLC is the only non-stock video/audio app that I have any experience with using computerized phones _  which I only got my 1st smartphone 2.5 yrs ago (I'm 55 yrs old & was satisfied with flipphones and my iMac desktops - until - Sept '16 my iMac was hacked by Russians and for 9 wks they went undetected from both me & iMac OS security & using Terminal to change permissions _  system op coding & etc etc to hide their daily use). BUT _  the VLC player is FAR better than 4 different stock video apps used,5,04/12/2019,8
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I've had this app on almost every cell phone and laptop that I've owned _  and it's been always a great app. Even though lately it has been acting up _  not showing my new music and video additions on the library _  and not playing videos at their regular speed.,4,02/20/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I always use VLC to watch movies but it could be a lot better if the screen will auto rotate even if it's locked. Also _  there are times when I pause a video and use different app like facebook or any other app _  the video will start from the beginning instead of resuming where i left of.,5,09/26/2018,3
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Really love this app 😍... In the new version there's a problem i wanna share... When some song is playing _  the app gets slow for some reason I don't know. Scrolling up and down is slow _  switching tabs from audio to video is slow. All was smooth in previous version. Hope that the devs may solve this bug...,4,02/01/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,i can hear my music _  this is good. BUT: suddenly  _  months ago and there is no bettering there _  it begun to "empty" my playlists. the playlist is there _  but empty. ans only one at a time works. if i make a playlist _  the other one that i had before _  is now empty. i also have to always control if the songs are still in the playlist _  as its half empty all of a sudden also _  it has deleted songs from my albums. like there is only the score left in Moana. i have the cd _  but i cant just always restock,2,12/20/2018,92
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Wished the sort filter had the "date added" included like before. Now _  you have three choices: name _  file name _  and length. Not sure what the difference is between the first two choices _  seems redundant. This is my preferred app to play my media. Keep up the good work.,4,05/20/2019,9
App884,org.videolan.vlc,So far the best app I've used for simple library identification and playback. Tried several other apps including google play music. VLC is the only one that organizes albums in their correct order _  (by track # instead of annoying alphabetical) no matter the file type. That's huge. It's been ridiculous. Thanks VLC _  looking forward to other features &),5,12/09/2018,5
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I would have rated this 5 stars previously but moving the audio playlists from where they were to another directory has made it less pleasant to use and added in more steps to get to your playlists. -2 stars for a stupid and unnecessary change. If it goes back to how it was I'll update this. Yet again they have messed with the interface with no good reason to do so and made it arguably worse yet again in addition to making it forget all my playlists. I'm removing another star for that.,2,12/06/2019,38
App884,org.videolan.vlc,After most recent update vlc no longer plays video _  all I get is a vlc traffic cone that looks like it's touching a screen mirror icon and playback of the sound from the video. I found the fix for this issue _  vlc needed permission to play on top of other apps. Once I enabled that vlc works great again. Another edit: this did not fix the problem.,1,03/17/2019,8
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Tested various players on a few years old tablet. Large video files. This is the only video player that allows extremely fast seeking times _  on a 2.8GB video it takes under 3 seconds to jump to another section of a video _  unbelievable. The only thing I need is file sizes when I browse the list of videos. Looks like there is no option to show that.,5,10/18/2018,190
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I used to absolutely love the beta version. This one I am having a terrible experience. This app rarely ever resumes playback from the last spot I left off and I don't like the jump to time feature. I wish it was still the scroll selector like in the beta version. Makes it much easier nagivating in with one hand.,3,09/14/2018,48
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I was looking for a video player that played in a pop up window and was pleased to see that VLC has this. It plays all my videos no problem and also has audio only playback which is nice. The only thing I would like to see added is a seek bar in the popup window so that I can skip forwards or backwards.,5,04/28/2019,17
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Nice equalizer. Looking for an app without a "random function" feature. Sometimes VLC shows a play button _  sometimes it doesn't. Somerimes it plays more than one song in a row; sometimes it doesn't. Tried it a second time. Won't read my SD card _  even with permission.,1,08/19/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,good but ive noticed as my gallery grew over time _  some of my videos and pictures would disappear from albums and the gallery all together. in files _ i can still see them but i cant access them _ redownload or change storage. basically telling me they're lost forever when the app says theyre still there,2,03/14/2019,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I must have tried 2-3 dozen different video players on various phones and tablets over the years and I always go back to VLC. It simply is the best _  most reliable _  and bloat free player I have come across on the android platform. 100% free with no ads/malware to boot.,5,04/02/2019,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,the player is an example of feature-rich software with none of features implemented well. screen orientation changes are random and hectic _  ignoring actual screen orientation. playlists just suck: no possibility to create and extend a Playlist other than by starting a video and pressing a button in tge contextual menu (bottom up approach). no possibility to manually rearrange the items in the Playlist. plus other counterintuitive ux things. in summary: overpromising underdelieverung,1,07/11/2019,16
App884,org.videolan.vlc,It's good that it plays any type of video that I have no other choice to make. But there are such things that need to be corrected. Whenever we lock the phone in the middle of a movie _  it doesn't resume but starts over again. And video gets bugs in the middle.. on the other hand pc version is a lot better and professional.,2,09/01/2019,68
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Actually expect better than this from VLC. Mainly _  issues with playlists make this a less than ideal choice. For one LARGE list _  all entries were duplicated! I could just remove one but it removes both _  thinking they are the same. Plays them all twice tho. Other glitches too like not remembering random play order etc make it frustrating to use. Oh yes _  apparently a database is used for the playlists too so no easy way to manage or backup or transfer. And _  no answers from support.,2,08/31/2019,115
App884,org.videolan.vlc,The only problem with this app is that it never goes next while playing from track list until you shuffle. If you play particular song from track list it keep on playing the same song until you play another and that also goes the same way. I would request the developer to fix the problem. By The way the app is great.,4,09/07/2019,105
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Everything is ok but there is an issue while casting media on a smart TV. When I play a media file through casting option and then I open another app _  the cast only lasts for a minute on the TV and then closes forcefully. I checked the running apps on settings and found out that the app closes one minute after running in the background. I also tried to find the option for keeping the app alive but failed. I am on android 9 and I think the app should have a built in option to run uninterruptedly.,5,09/10/2019,55
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Buggy as hell _  one day everything works fine _  then the next it can't play almost half of the playlist for no apparent reason _  just like that _  out of the blue. You can still see all the songs are still there _  but it will just skip half of the titles and display an error message _  why still play the rest is a mistery _  it looks as vlc has got a soul by itself and act autonomously _  deciding what to play and what not. ***Samsung Note 9***,1,09/19/2019,421
App884,org.videolan.vlc,works great... although I have 1 issue... whenever you download subtitles by the inbuilt feature... then switch to some other app or take a call or simply lock the screen and get back to the app again _  the subtitle is not available to load. if you try to download again it will show as already downloaded _  have since then found that the subtitles get downloaded into a downloads\VLC folder but it's really annoying to pause the video and navigate to the folder everytime.,4,06/20/2019,16
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I've been using VLC for PC and Android for years. Now when I turn the screen off and on again while watching a video it goes to audio mode and I have to change it back to video. please at least give the option to turn this feature off. some of us watch videos while doing chores etc and sometimes turn the screen off for a bit.,5,07/06/2019,81
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Great all round _  only one request. For videos with 2 or more audio languages _  the app defaults to the first audio and not one's preferred audio which for example is English. There should be a way of setting English as the default language so that we can avoid manually choosing the preferred language every time in multilingual video files. Thanks,4,08/04/2019,21
App884,org.videolan.vlc,best multimedia player for youtube _  movies _  music - this is coming from someone who has used A LOT of players on bsd _  windows _  android. Shame mpv is not here but this works flawlessly as expected. Those of you who want to background your Youtube videos/audio playlists _  this gets the job done painlessly with a notify feature allowing you to see the status. MUST HAVE on every device tbh.,5,08/14/2019,241
App884,org.videolan.vlc,there is a bug _  which leads to app freeze. When timer is set and it reaches its end _  from that time is is not possible to restart play from any source. App needs to be force closed and then it is possible to select source to play again. It was observed in m3u streaming as well as playing local mp3. Using android 9 and Samsung s9. Vlc support is unresponsive too.,3,09/07/2019,99
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Unlike its desktop counterpart _  this app is counterintuitive and glitchy. For example _  why do I have to play a track and then open the playlist it is under in order to rearrange its order?? The issue of doubling the songs on said list has also frustrated me to no end _  as I spend more time deleting the double entries than actually listening to the music... After which the entire playlist is deleted along with the tracks _  forcing me to re-populate it. I'm extremely fed up and definitely moving on.,2,09/11/2019,1558
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Not happy with this app. I need an app for my android tablet that will not only play/display from the sd card from my dashcam & trailcams _  but I need to be able to save and share those images as well. This app plays the videos very well _  but there is no way to save or share the images. Several complaints about this on the VSL website. Guess I have to find a different app because using my phone to film the video while it's playing on my tablet is a pain in the a$$.,1,11/17/2019,16
App884,org.videolan.vlc,What the heck did you do to this app? I can't find anything anymore. It's a jumbled mess when it comes to organizing the videos. Can only sort by name. Doesn't put them in a folder like it use to. Used the app all the time _  but going to ha e to find a new video player until it's fixed.,1,12/07/2019,4
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Really appreciate all the hard work on the background in order for us to enjoy these app. I tried it no failure or breaking when playing this app. Well done high appreciate this great work.,5,12/22/2019,7
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Why there is a mention of Audio Delay option in the settings when it's not there? Please bring back the Audio Delay feature!,4,12/21/2019,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I've always liked the app. It's my "GO TO" music app.,5,01/05/2020,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Great app except 50% of the time _  the app hangs after playing a video. Getting stuck with a black screen I can't exit from _  it either resets my phone or I have to remove and re-insert the battery to make it work again. Re-installs and updates don't work _  have been patient for at least a year.,1,11/07/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Nice application. I'm use daily in my smartphone,5,02/08/2020,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Oh Mah Gawd!!! FINALLY a media player that will find every media file on my note3. I love you VLC . PLEASE NEVER CHANGE. An app like this deserves a ton of stars. You devs who made this app _  thank you. So good. Much props!,5,02/11/2020,0

App884,org.videolan.vlc,Yoooo ULLLLLLLLL the new update is litty 🤙🏾🤙🏾 the new UI is clean and easier to use/see. Plus they fixed an issue regarding my phone (S10+) Honestly wouldn't expect anything less from the folks at VLC. 5 Stars. 👍🏽,5,12/08/2019,15
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Awesome video player. No complaints. Does what it is meant to and there are zero hassles. Plays about anything.,5,12/11/2019,14
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Recent update messed up the app's capability to download subtitles. The rest of it's features are intact. I just don't like the new display.,3,12/12/2019,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I love the app first of all but the latest update has screwed everything up. I used to be able to access files through vlc but after the update all my folders are marked empty. Fix this please,2,12/13/2019,4

App884,org.videolan.vlc,Has an Equalizer. Great app but is now minimizing itself when turning screen back on. Use to be easy to rewind a video to rehear something _  but now always minimized when turning screen back on. Looking for player/settings reset but don't think I changed anything. Might have to go with another player. Was never doing it before update.,3,04/26/2019,4
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Only video player _  other than my android one _  that will continue VIDEO PLAYBACK if I exit the video screen whenever I have my phone connected to the the tv with HDMI... UNFORTUNATELY _  IT ONLY PLAYS IT FOR 2 MINUTES THEN FREEZES... MY ANDROID PLAYER CONTINUES VIDEO PLAYBACK WHENEVER THE PHONES CONNECTED TO THE TV WITH HDMI CABLE _  so I'm able to do anything else with my phone like browse _  text _  etc... while watching a video from my phone onto my big screen... this other video apps are just a waste,2,04/09/2019,7
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Slowed down my Nvidia Shield TV to a snail's pace upon first bootup _  as it decided to scan my two external drives automatically. This is NOT how a media player should act. Instead _  a competent dev would give the option to manually designate folder pathways at the START of the app. Uninstalling VLC fixed my Shield TV. AVOID THIS APP AND USE MX PLAYER INSTEAD.,1,01/30/2019,2
App884,org.videolan.vlc,We all know about VLC _  the legendary go-to video player. But please _  for the love of God _  don't limit subtitles to be rendered only on movie / picture. If the movie is higher than 16:9 and there are thick horizontal black lines above and below the picture _  please let us use it for subtitles.. Same "problem" on PC for years now. Don't "force-fit-to-inside-picture" the subtitles and don't scale them to max size of the picture. Use display resolution limits _  not the resolution of the video/movie..,4,01/09/2019,39
App884,org.videolan.vlc,The app is OK BUT _  when I delete a song or video _  the title does not go away _  why? It's like it has thumbnails. Why? I don't like that. I expect that when I delete a song _  it should go away completely. That is my problem with vlc Also _  I can't create my own Playlist. 👎👎👎👎,5,10/15/2018,24
App884,org.videolan.vlc,SUDDENLY _  after years of success with this app _  it RANDOMLY sometimes starts a song file by starting 2 seconds into the song but only playing a tenth of a second of it _  then blank space _  then picking back up _  2 more seconds into the song. Whatever you idiots did to this app _  WHICH WAS WORKING JUST FINE BEFORE YOUR RECENT UPDATES _  THANKS. I am now your biggest and most vocal critic. I even factory reset my device and downloaded a fresh version on VLC player _  and _  yup _  same malfunction. Idiots.,1,04/27/2019,3
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Was a top notch until recently _  I have tons of music videos on my phone I love to chromecast _  but with recent updates now none of the vids will refresh and appear on VLC _  even after uninstalling and reinstallation _  and despite the fact the file folder is in the VLC video directory. Extremely frustrating _  I now use another player but will hang on to this app to see if an update will fix this issue _  otherwise this won't be of much use to me,2,01/10/2019,100
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Brilliant app _  with many ways to customise your experience etc. however I am having a problem where my deleted videos are still showing up on VLC and I cannot remove them. Refresh doesn't seem to work. Edit: I have found a solution to the problem. Changing from 4 star to 5 star it really is a brilliant app.,5,02/25/2019,2
App884,org.videolan.vlc,update killed it. videos will not play from where they left after switching screen off and on. comes back only audio. I was so happy to have found excellent functions at a player. I 'll downgrade if I can. 😀 I m sure all will be fixed. I 'll raise 3 stars to 5 when done.,3,04/12/2019,3
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I'm either a dinosaur or a snob with music. I still carry a high resolution dedicated Walkman to listen to. I never use a phone for music _  today I tried putting an album on my phone to see if I'd like it. After setting Android and vlc settings to my liking _  the music sounds good but every time a new song starts it skips! That's a deal breaker...,2,03/01/2019,51
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Excellent app like the desktop version too _  but Android app should display movies in SBS just to see them with Google cardboard devices! What are you waiting to add that feature? Would be the best all in one media player and you are just a fraction of an inch to achieve that!,4,03/03/2019,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,This seems to have been going down hill over the last few versions  I use this to listen to audio books and chose it over other free programs because it was a non profit which I admired  But the main problem for me is that many audio books are a single file 10 hours or more in length and you will tend to pause the playback frequently  With this app it loses its place every time you get a phone call _  it loses its place just when you open some apps _  it seems to lose its place sometimes just when the phone is charging and loses its place when the battery is low or the device powers off NONE of which is a problem it used to have in older versions where at the very least you would press play and it would start from where you started to play the file last time  And as trying to go back and forth trying to find the point of the book you were up to in a 10 or 16 hour audio book on a 5 inch screen even in landscape is a frigging nightmare and when a book is split in chapters which can often be over 100 chapters and it forgets you HAVE to play the first file then use the step forwards one file button _  because if you try to run the chapter you were up to it just plays that ONE chapter only,2,01/14/2019,2
App884,org.videolan.vlc,It's amazing _  just plain and simple... I just wish that even if we were screen mirroring with the app or projecting it _  we could still add thir to subtitles and if our device accidentally goes off _  the subtitles aren't aslo take away meaning I have to add them again But it is purely amazing,4,04/23/2019,14
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I'll just give 2 starts. not satisfied . every time I play the vedio and clicked the subtitle _ will appeared at the first episode but when I play for the next ep. the subtle of first ep will play on the second episode and it's irritating .... I've tried to fix it but still won't work .,2,03/19/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I just want to say thank yall for giving me an easy to use _  all thing's covered _  multimedia app. When music is warmth for the soul _  it just doesn't work without the sunshine _  and that would be this app. lol js. And no ad's! Thank you to you and your dedicated volunteer's _  great job.,5,03/02/2019,2
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I love the app very much _  use it in all my devices. However _  with Huawei P20 lite _  the app constantly stops playing music whenever the display turns off and continues to play when display is on as a result as much I enjoy the app I had to uninstall cause I cannot and do not want to keep my device's display on all the time in order to enjoy my music.,1,12/05/2018,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,awesome...if u r a binge watcher this app is for you...seriously it regroups your episodes fabulously...must download...👍btw I have not been told by the app to rate...I am rating it myself...👏(edit) It's been a month or two...and there is a defect that it shows subtitles at the top and squeezed letters...correct that and I will give you 5 🌟 again.,3,01/17/2019,2
App884,org.videolan.vlc,The PC version of this app is powerful (inarguably). But this android version does not live up to it's name. It has lots of unnecessary features and makes it cluttered. During video playback you notice your screen is filled with icons and stuff _  and that deep colour pfff.,4,06/09/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Excellent tool for playing just about every video format. Controls are a little slow to respond. One BIG feature that is missing _  and would be extremely useful _  is the ability to take screenshots from video (would really like to be able to screenshot 4K video for stills). A great _  if spartan _  app nonetheless!,4,09/22/2019,262
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I've been using vlc for years on pc an mobile and it works great! No problems or bugs what so ever! Not even on my old Samsung J1 does it have any problems! Easy to use _  Intuitive and way better than google play music! It plays louder than play music app _  the equalizer is easily accesable _  everything is neatly organised and easy to find. Also if you're wondering wether this is the same as the one on pc _  yes it is!,5,09/22/2019,540
App884,org.videolan.vlc,everything is good in vlc. however _  I'd like one very important feature to be added. vlc needs to let the user control the padding of subtitles in player _ 18:9 devices are very common now and some videos _ when zoomed to full screen _ start hiding the subtitles below the video making them not possible to view. please please fix this.,4,06/20/2019,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Your apps was working perfectly until the newest update. Now I can't easily download subtitles anymore from the in-app settings.,3,12/09/2019,2
App884,org.videolan.vlc,My issues are - 1. The sorting of video list _  it should also have option to display videos in terms of folder _  video files of one folder is scattered around the entire list _  i tried all possible way but failed. So VLC look for it and add option to sort by folder or folder view and arrange folder sequence manually. 2. Missing folder lock option. 3. i also faced issue with downloads files names _  it shows website name instead of actual file names while MX Player shows correct name for same files.,3,08/03/2019,40
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I use VLC on both my Chromebook and my iMAC. Love it's ability to play odd file types _  that it goes and gets codecs it needs and how it can 'often fix' a partially broken file that no other app will play. When friends express frustration with other (often native) players _  I just tell them to download VLC _  and they are always glad they did. I would like a little bit more ability to fast forward _  but I realize that depends on file type.,5,08/06/2019,1360
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Pretty good except for the utterly useless media search. Space seems to be interpreted as "or" rather than "and" (why) _  stuff seems to match based on containing a substring within an edit distance _  and heaven help you if you're searching in Japanese. Desktop has none of these problems _  what the hell.,3,08/11/2019,20
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I have been trying to download subtitles for many movies _  it's not working. They will just show me that it has finished downloading but there is still no subtitles. When you delete a video from your phone _  it won't delete from the VLC _  till you uninstall and reinstall again.,1,08/04/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,i will change my rating to 5 stars once you fix the casting feature. The cast button appears sporadically and at times is not available despite every other app in my phone being able to cast on the chromecast. Neflix _  Youtube _  Soundcloud _  MX Player _  Spotify _  Google Home are all able to cast but VLC won't show ke an option to do so. Considering I downloaded the application for casting _  this is not going so well.,2,08/19/2019,17
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Great _  except a few issues... If you own a 3 band WiFi router router (Asus 11000) & w/ Gigabit (both up & down) network this app in a fast _  quality device like my Samsung Galaxy Note 9 512GB (8GB RAM) _  this app still will not cast 4K video no matter how much RAM _  device screen resolution _  CPU _  network speed & settings in it I have. So the app still needs a fair amount of work. It is very good otherwise & I use it quite a bit.,4,12/04/2019,23
App884,org.videolan.vlc,After updating the the 'double tap for 10 seconds forward' not working properly. Please check it. It is very annoying. 😂,1,12/20/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I used to love this app and swore by it but recently I've had nothing but issues with casting videos. It either stops or you lose the UI so can't control the vid.,3,12/08/2019,5

App884,org.videolan.vlc,It is the best video player there is period,5,12/31/2019,16
App884,org.videolan.vlc,One of the best apps I've ever used. Not just media player one of the best app I've ever used period. So many options for the video player every single option or feature I could possibly want is already built into the app. Seriously good job designing and building this app. Some apps even from major companies _  especially canadian companies and apps are so poorly designed and programmed they are unusable. VLC exceeded expectations and hit it out if the park.,5,11/15/2019,13
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Only app that plays hevc/h264/h265 video streams flawlessly on a mediocre wifi connection for me (tried bs & mx player before). BUT sftp does not work for me! Keeps asking for a password even though I entered one (the correct one). I triple checked my server config and it works except with VLC for Android (Tested Kodi _  windows _  macOS _  Thunar (xfce file thingy)). Please fix then 5 stars! Reply and I will give more details. Happy bug hunting. Thanks for showing blender shorts in the screenshots btw,3,04/08/2019,24
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I love this app and I continue to use it despite the glitch I'm about to describe however the glitch forces me to uninstall VLC for Android until I need to use it because when I connect to a Bluetooth device 4 audio it automatically loads and fails to connect to the video and continually pops up out of control once they fix that bug the app will be near-perfect.. I will note that it tries to play wifi networked videos through my 4G connection lol,4,11/21/2019,0

App884,org.videolan.vlc,Last upgrade totally broke it. Only one song is detected. App acting super random. Edit: adding 1 star because unselecting the folders to scan and reselecting them made my tracks come back.,2,12/07/2019,5

App884,org.videolan.vlc,Great app _  but streaming from youtube broke recently. It was a handy way to avoid ads (share to vlc from the yt app) so a fix would be greatly appreciated!,5,12/24/2019,16
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Been using this app for videos for years but the cast on it is terrible. It will cast the video to my chrome cast but the video blanks after 2 minutes _  fix this and it would be a 5*again,4,12/22/2019,1

App884,org.videolan.vlc,i always felt vlc was a 5 star application. used it forever for .mkv on pc and android. some phones it has its issues. others not really but tbh i expect that on android; since of course _  on pc ive never had a issue im happy with this existing on a phone :) dont care about bugs when the key functionality im looking for is there. thank you for being great.,5,12/22/2018,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Its the best you can get for pc and the best on mobile too. plays absolutely anything like a charm. no issues ever in all my years of use for musicand video. in fact the only player ive found for mobile that can even find all of my music files. this program wins a hard earned and very rare 10/10 from me. just good work,5,10/28/2018,2
App884,org.videolan.vlc,***UPDATE*** I found the Chromecast option but it is very hidden. It would be nice if instead of being in playback controls it was more upfront E.G in More Options menu. Otherwise this is a fantastic app 👍👍👍😁 ***Original Review*** Good app but no Chromecast support :( please add casting support.,4,03/07/2019,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I saw that the newest version targets Android 9.0 and instantly thought I'd have to downgrade since every other app I use is forced to ignore the corners on devices with a notch leaving a useless black bar. But I was pleasantly surprised to see that VLC still allows content to be displayed there in full screen mode.,5,04/08/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Good application but you have reduce the sound volume _  remember the sound volume was 120 I think but now it is 100 only _  I ask for the initiators Of this application to return on its former level of sound _  it was very fantastic _  but the application is really good I like it,5,03/30/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,VLC is undisputably the most powerful video player app on playstore _  i have been using mx player for a long time up till i downloaded a video which mx player could not handle and i started to look for another app but had liitle hope that there would be some app as pwrfull and loaded with features as mx plyr but o my my VLC "no add" loaded with features and played the video perfectly and smoothly .. deserves 5 star,5,04/03/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,playing video on my 6 _ 3 inch screen in potrait mode caused VLC's navigation buttons overlapped by android's navigation buttons (the 3 buttons at the bottom) so I'm unable to use your buttons unless I rotate my screen to landscape. hope a fix to this cause there are some videos that came in vertical mode.,4,04/27/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,as a powerful video and audio player that exists as Free and Open Source Software _  i feel there are glitches occuring in the latest version that should be easily fixed. audio muting after seek for example (mobile LG G6 phone). to be desired are more functions to modify layout as well as playback parameters.,3,01/13/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,This app was previously good _  _  _  but now I don't know. Videos that I deleted are can still be seen in the app even when a refresh it _  it doesn't go and new videos that I expect it to appear are not found. Please fix this problem. Thank You,3,03/17/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,While I prefer the original on my computer _  this app version is pretty awesome as well. My only problem is that it'll randomly forget my place in the audiobooks I listen to. It's annoying. I still prefer it to any other media player app for Android.,4,04/09/2019,20
App884,org.videolan.vlc,The app is good but it needs some improvements; it doesn't have show by folder option _  in locks screen when you press pause and screen locks again _  for resuming again must unlock phone and open app again because controllers are gone _  it doesn't have choosing speed for player. If they fix these I will give 5 star.,3,11/16/2018,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,just about every vehicle on earth allows you to adjust the balance _  therefore every audio application gets 1 star till they add a balancer. nobody has perfect ears especially when it comes to centering the sound in the brain or what people call the inner ear. Balancing improves all sound especially vocals and enhances binaural beats to be more effective. why is this no longer a setting on most phones either?,1,08/11/2019,21
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Can't find my videos and during watching the video its slightly uncomfortable .... Request to dev that make it more user friendly and fun during video is playing  _ help of some animations or something .....yeah for me its only like my old android stock video player instead of that it must have more features in now a day's ......,3,11/01/2018,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,The app was working fantastically _  until it was updated. For some reason it has trouble finding my video and audio files on my local storage. I travel a lot and I often download my media entertainments so I can be distracted on the go. Please fix issues because I love VLC!!! Been my go-to media player since 2012.,3,07/09/2019,18
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Since the update the sleep timer no longer works and turning your phone on its side to make to time bar bigger no longer works either. The app also does no save where you are in audio files _  so you have to start from the begging each time and try to find your place. Which use to be much easier when you could turn your phone and make the bar at the bottom bigger,1,04/14/2019,314
App884,org.videolan.vlc,hello  _  To VLC . thank you for this great app  _  I use it to view my media via Chromecast. but there is un issue _  If I downloaded a subtitle from outside the app the subtitle won't show on the tv using Chromecast. I have Chromecast 3 and it's updated to the last version. I really hope that you guys fix this problem. thank you again 🌹,5,05/27/2019,2
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Love vlc desktop _  hate this app. It has the SAME issues like other ones. Go to use the shuffle feature and it doesn't shuffle. Won't shuffle when I press the forward button on my car or from the widget. It works half the time. But Samsung default app works fine and other devices don't have an issue. Problem is the default Samsung app sucks for using it as a folder player and blacklisting certain folders.,1,09/18/2019,41
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Program is good for people without hearing problems. For those of us not so lucky _  VLC contains a glitch that causes subtitle failure after pausing for a couple of minutes. It is most disconcerting. I've starting using a non-VideoLan player.,2,06/15/2019,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,This app would have 5 stars from me if it wasn't for these issues that I find annoying: - Sometimes the playlist disappears and you have to go off the app and back on it a few times for it to show up again - I can't seem to stop time stretching even though the option is disabled - Sometimes the rewind button gets stuck and I have to restart the track - Remember playback position on/off makes no difference _  if I play a long track it will always remember where it left off and resume from there,4,09/28/2019,66
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I have been using VLC for quite a while now _  and I would easily recommend it above all other video players out there _  even MX Player. It contains no annoying advertisments _  and it's very smooth with all audio video formats _  plus the UI design is also very simplistic. By far the best one out there _  love it 😘😘😘,5,07/12/2019,443
App884,org.videolan.vlc,This app help me with my headache dealing with other video player apps. Doesn't need to download any additional apps and still capable to play any video that you throw at it. That's just one of many wonderful features that this app got. Definitely worth downloading.,5,07/23/2019,4
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Don't get me wrong; vlc is my favorite media player. However one programmer's shallow _  unimaginative _  lazy thinking can (and very often does) ruin a formerly excellent piece of software. This version's utter obliviousness to the user's need for the software to _hold the user's place_ (in an 11-hour file or 40-item playlist _  e.g.) for more than a few minutes' pause _  is enough for me to abandon this technically far superior phone for one whose vlc version does not 'feature' such forgetfulness.,1,07/09/2019,53
App884,org.videolan.vlc,The UI is kinda fast-paced and desperately lacks explination (a one-time help window isn't super helpful) but it's great for viewing videos sent over the internet without downloading them in full _  and I haven't experienced any crashes with it at all. Has some problems with smooth looping and does a bunch of weird aspect ratio adjusting between every loop.,3,10/28/2019,55
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I used this app very happily for quite a while. But the latest update seems to have made it so that when repeating a song _  it jumps to the middle of the song. Very annoying. I hope the programmers are able to nail down the issue _  especially since fits my (simple) needs so well otherwise.,3,08/27/2019,22
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Completely awesome _  simple to work & easier to learn new ways of using it even easier than desktop version.I fell in Love with VLC player a long time ago & never looked back.It plays .iso format right from a dvd Wow what else can do that! Probably other programs i'm sure but not a lot & price..?Who knows??Upon Googling it VLC came up first. When reading up on the subject you realize VLC can rip also burn if i remember right & many many other features only waiting to be discovered!!,5,09/05/2019,29
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Everything works fine to a point. The go back a track shortcut doesn't work on some versions of Android because long press doesn't apparently get sent to the app. Sometimes a playlist will sort itself alphabetically in visuals only and it might only happen in dark mode. There things are easy to work around though _  and in terms of actually playing media everything works perfectly fine,5,10/24/2018,2245
App884,org.videolan.vlc,There is only one bug. Not sure if it is a bug or intentional making. When i play the video in audio mode _  it starts from where i left off earlier (which is good) _  but when i keep it in "loop one" _  it again starts from the same place where it was expected to start from the beginning.,5,11/16/2019,16
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I like VLC _  but the new version doesn't work well with my nas over smb. I have D-Link DNS320L Nas _  and after updating vlc _  Nas appear in the list _  but I can't connect to it. What's the problem with it?,3,12/09/2019,3
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I have been an avid VLC user from PC to Mobile since 2009. I will never use anything else for PC. I would be just as adamant about the mobile version but there are a few hiccups. Since the last updates I've had to delete VLC and reinstall due to it stopping at random when playing music and distorted videos. I also would like to be able to edit playlist orders. Reinstall seems to have fixed the stopping music problem on Galaxy S9.,3,10/18/2019,62

App884,org.videolan.vlc,There is nothing to tell the app to JUST #_&!!!! PLAY!!! It plays the same thing over and over. The random play just plays the same group of songs or artists again and again. Used to be a good player years ago but used to be does not cut it. This is a frustrating piece of garbage now just the same as all of the other players.,2,11/17/2018,2087
App884,org.videolan.vlc,VLC player app for Android is good for playing videos and audio since it supports for all the formats though not supported by other app. But only issue is with google Chromecast. Streaming is ended after 5 and 7 minutes _  this has been reported in videolan website and most of the mentioned in review here _  but videolan hasn't given any fix or solution to this _  this is really a big concern for us,3,11/14/2019,5

App884,org.videolan.vlc,The latest version is causing stability issue when using sleep function.

Also _  the thumbnails generated from old media that dod not exist currently _  are not being cleared automatically _  eating up free space.,2,12/01/2019,4
App884,org.videolan.vlc,the only thing i have a complaint about is the eq ive always wished it had more frequency bands a 31 band eq would make this the greatest app howeverif you were to add at the very least 25hz 40hz 18khz and 20khz frequency bands in the next version that would be better. thats at the bare min tho a full blown 31 band eq would be so much better and would be worth the effort ya vlc always has been a nice multi media player its come a long way especially on android but this is the biggest issue in my opinion for audio junkies such as my self,4,12/13/2018,2
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Took me a bit to learn how to make a playlist with more than one song but other than that it's great. VLC gives you the ability to play many more audio/video extensions that normally you couldn't using your phone's original features.,4,03/22/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,One of the best video player _  but with room of improvement. It can be better if it has the option to categorise the videos by their original folders. And currently the video player doesn't remember the sorting option _  it always back to 'name' everytime closed and re- open the app.,4,09/18/2018,23
App884,org.videolan.vlc,is it so hard???? You added some nice new tunes to your phone or SD card? Well... good luck to you _  you wont find them for a few days _  because refreshing songs is just too much of a task for the App.... But it has the best Equalizer.,3,01/28/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I have got a serious problem with this app please help me very Fast ..I am Using Huawei P smart when I play music after some few seconds when my screen lock the music just stop playing and I have tried to GO through setting but its not helping please help I so Love this App I have been using it ever since I started using Android phone(2015) please help I can rate this app with ★★★★★,1,04/09/2019,13
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Recently I downloaded a video file. however while playing the video on VLC _  a message is being displayed that Xvid Video codec is required for playing the file. Till now I was thinking that VLC us the most updated video player which have all the codecs and plays allmost all the files. I request to add Xvid video codec too for us users. Regards,3,03/02/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Please bring "sort by new" or "sort by date modified" back. Why has it been removed?,1,03/10/2020,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,With the new update _  clicking "shuffle" to play a random song pops up a "loading" message that takes ~5 seconds to resolve before a song starts playing. This is absurd given that I'm on a pixel 2 and have only about 3k songs _  and it was not true in the old version.,2,04/04/2019,59
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Great music and videos player. If you don't have it _  get it now. I do come across some bug when I hold the next buttons to seek through my music. The app kinda just continues to press the button even after I stop pressing. Not many issues here.,4,09/29/2018,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Since the update on 20th March _  lots of individual songs have been moved out of their album entry into a separate _  identically named album under the same artist. Very frustrating and far too many to simply fix up by looking into the tags for each mp3 and fixing it up. Has happened throughout my large library _  seemingly at random.,3,03/22/2019,943
App884,org.videolan.vlc,VLC on pc is awesome and i really like the android version except the one fact that it seems to care more about rescanning for new media than it does letting me access what is already there. Sometimes videos are loaded but music is not _  and vice versa. I still use it though because I trust the integrity of this company's software.,3,02/01/2019,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,GREAT VIDEO PLAYER FOR ANY FORMAT!!! but why the one star??? because I just found out that it is the only app that has been going through my snapchat files + old pictures off my SD memory card... ES File explorer tracks activity of files being created. VLC has created it's own folder with thumbnails of what it has been viewing. i'm talking about pictures from 2+ years ago which I havent bothered to open in the last week yet they manage to view them as well as saved snapchats recent and long ago.,1,03/21/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,When playing longer mp3 files _  the app will constantly _  and annoyingly _  start from the middle of the track. No way to fix it without reinstalling the app. If VLC closes while playing _  there should be a dialog box asking if we want to start from where we left off _  or from the beginning of the track. Will uninstall completely if it keeps happening.,2,01/31/2019,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,i use vlc on a daily. lately it has been weird. Everytime i am watching a movie on my android _  i go to another app then switch back to the movie _  it used to just keep playing from where i left it but now it comes back blank and then i have to find in the cue where i left it,2,04/24/2019,4
App884,org.videolan.vlc,VLC is one of those apps _  it's been around for ages _  but it somehow manages to stay great. This app is mt video app on ALL my devices and it mever ever gives me problems. I love the features that's built into it and I appreciate the fact that they added the features that the desktop version has _  into the mobile version.,5,04/16/2019,410
App884,org.videolan.vlc,VLC version 3.1.7 _  I've emailed developer with no response _  using Samsung Galaxy Note 9 and this keeps crashing after about 10 minutes of music play time _  new version interface sucks _  not as convenient to go through music and it keeps rubberbanding back to the beginning. I love the PC version _  hopefully developer team will listen to reviewers and make some changes or email back their consumers. Cheers!,1,08/30/2019,20
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I really like the app _  use it on my pc all the time as well. The only thing I would improve on the mobile app is the ability to cast subtitle files alongside video content _  this would improve the app so much more. Please integrate this feature into your latest version of the mobile app!,4,06/12/2019,55
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Extremely confusing _  non-typical media interface. Poor volume control when casting. Volume is almost dead silent _  even with the 200% boost option selected. You have to turn up the TV volume to max _  then blow your eardrums out when returning to other media. Eratic casting ability. Uninstalled.,1,09/30/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,This app is really good _  support à variety of codec and a variety of container however I really hate the fact that we can play video from a archive like the pc version do.,3,12/11/2019,2
App884,org.videolan.vlc,no feature for continue playback with screen off automatically. ie i wanna be able to go into any app and the video is working in a popup then i decide to put my phone in the pocket for a second and turn the screen off it gatta continue working and playing. i pull it out unlock and it works perfect no stutter nothing just keeps on playing and playing. right now vlc does only the first part. thats it. add this feature.,2,07/09/2019,17
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Audio for .Mov files used to work excellent. The latest Android OS update (9) has left it so choppy that it is unusable. Tried to uninstall and reinstall even deleting the base files but it's still wrecked. VLC _  Android has forced an update _  time to fix your codec to keep up. Samsung Galaxy S8 Active Android OS version 9.,1,07/25/2019,7
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I've been loyal to VLC for over 10 years. I'm very disappointed because of the lack of equaliser settings. This is essential for a such a simple app. I'm under the impression that it has been removed from previous versions. I'm sadly switching away from VLC until they update with an equaliser.,3,11/20/2019,5
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Why you need to change something that was good _  even perfect before? The new ui is horrible! Too big icons _  and you removed the most important icon from the ui _  the resize screen. I know its there on the "..." menu _  but hides half the screen when i try to calibrate the screen size. I needed 3 tap before to start a video with perfect screensize _  even while was running _  now i need to lose precious time to watch anything and "the time is money". Bring back the old ui _  this one is frustrating.,2,12/05/2019,42
App884,org.videolan.vlc,This update cannot display playlist while video is playing. Unless you play the video in a sequence order . Please fix it,3,12/22/2019,1

App884,org.videolan.vlc,Vlc is one of the best app i ever used.. there only a slight problem that i couldn't download subtitles.. anyway keep up the good works..,3,01/31/2020,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I've used this app for quite a while now and loved it _  but the new update kind of destroyed everything... When i open it the app automatically tilts everything to the side and i didnt find a setting to undo that. And in general i just dont like the new look and how everything is set up and organized at all... I had hoped i wouldnt have to look for another audio player anymore because VLC is so good _  but now i will probably have to,3,12/04/2019,24
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Love the last update ! Screenshots are not updated in the description (play store). Definitely considering getting involved in the development if I have time to do so,5,12/12/2019,4
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I love this new vlc. Speaking from a guy who has been an avid vlc user. Am talking about win xp times. You guys have outdone yourself. Its so beautiful. Tip for new users. Enable black theme.👍vlc keep up.👏👏👏,5,12/10/2019,3
App884,org.videolan.vlc,They should never had done this last update. Issues of display _  no possibility to delete videos with VLC anymore _  inferior design. Extremely bad update _  just erase this update and put the older version back.,1,12/17/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,One Great Tool. If you use it and think of it as the swiss army knife of media necessities _  you will not be disappointed. You can stay as basic or go as deep as you need from my experience. It's not going to be as "slick" or "pretty" as some others _  but I have never had an issue with it or not been able to open a file. I use another player exclusively for music _  and this for everything else and music as well sometimes. Have used it on desktop for years _  one of those apps I keep coming back to.,5,12/27/2019,2
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Very well players,5,04/23/2020,0

App884,org.videolan.vlc,so it's relatively amazing video player _  though the only thing makes me lose my mind is that when I flip my galaxy S9 plus sideways the brightness goes down _  but the percentage stays at 100% and it makes me lose my $hit.. its way darker even on 100% brightness at landscape mode. i am opened for suggestions.,4,02/05/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,EXTREMELY buggy when using Chromecast. You also can't turn off autorotate _  so you're definitely going to accidentally hit a button or find yourself in the middle of the movie on accident. In general _  when using Chromecast with this you'll be faced with constant disruption.,3,12/05/2018,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,This app is almost perfect because there is only one thing that makes me give it 4 star and that is its online video streaming feature by pasting url. This feature is good but slow and low efficient. So please make this feature better for smooth streaming.,4,10/02/2018,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Great on PC _  horrible on Android! Doesn't support vast music extensions as it should _  every time it opens _  VLC requires an ENTIRE memory scan for media files _  and playing on shuffle is so cheaply programmed that it constantly loses its place when going forwards/backwards from songs I would like to hear again.,2,11/28/2018,2
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Opened VLC _  started to play a video _  switched to another app (audio is playing in the background. good) switched back to VLC _  Video changed to audio. I need to click the video button get the video back --> Fix this. If i switch to another app while playing a video _  I need to get the video back when i switch back to VLC. Thanks.,2,04/22/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,You have to select one by one to add on the playlist. Extremely fiddely. It shows annoying tips overlaying on top of the video and audio 10 sec _  everytime you open the file. and there is no option to disable it. stresses me out. I am tired of using this app.,1,05/06/2019,4
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Everything was good in this app _  till I noticed that while downloading a video _  it doesn't reflect on the player screen no matter how many times I refresh it. This surely deserves an upgrade with better features.,3,12/02/2018,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,It crashes my Galaxy Tab S2 VE 9.7 _  one time in three when casting to my Chromecast. it cause the device to restart _  but then doesn't detect the memory card. it requires another full restart to detect the memory card. It's a real pain in the proverbial butt!,2,03/11/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Good overall user experience. | Bugs: • videos sometimes retain the original name even after a rename • videos in picture in picture mode only follow the contour of 16:9 aspect ratios | Suggestions: • Give the app a more pleasing look/feel (e. g. _  Spotify _  Hulu _  & VRV) • Allow us to categorize videos/folders & select their order (e. g. _  A-Z _  popularity _  or manually) • + a quick access option for recently added/watched videos (e. g. _  spotify home page) • + Video grouping by non-parent folders,4,04/09/2019,7
App884,org.videolan.vlc,It's VLC _  of course it's brilliant. But I've switched phones to the One Plus 6T _  and the app crashes to a black screen every time i minimise and then go back to it. I'd have to restart the app and whatever it is that i'm watching from the beginning each time. Please fix this.,3,04/25/2019,17
App884,org.videolan.vlc,its worst than the older one....before the updated version...i can full control in my sd card..i can play audio and video directly from the vlc player...but now...the updated vlc player its not work properly. and i cant explore me sd card from vlc...and the vlc cant read my card..i like the orlder version..but this version need some bug fixes and solve some issues,1,04/19/2019,15
App884,org.videolan.vlc,its perfect for most users. i personally prefer a more old fashioned obvious text heavy gui to vlc's which I constantly forget how to use but for the average person im guessing its intuitive. anyhow its wealth of features configurability and lack of ads low resource use and it plays in the bg? how much better could it get? thanks devs!!!,5,05/23/2019,11
App884,org.videolan.vlc,You know... I'm sick and tired of the "can't keep the playlist between the sessions" feature in 2019. But if we'll forget about that annoyance _  this player is one of the most powerful free multipurpose tools out there.,4,04/11/2019,8
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Good app _  more advanced than almost every media player I've ever used. I like it even if it could be better if subtitles were working on the spot. They take time to show up and you can't move them on the upper screen or anywhere else on th screen. Think of making your app the best in any way.,4,02/09/2019,2
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Dear developer. This is an amazing player so far with awesome sound quality as i use the same player in my laptop but since few days I am having a bit of problem now that vlc sometimes does not play video but sound comes out & 2ndly i cannot play complete audio list. Woukd appreciate if you could help me out in this,5,05/19/2019,16
App884,org.videolan.vlc,if your version of VLC is working _  do not update to this version. I loved this app and used it for internet radio. After the update _  it didn't find my media or playlists. Luckily _  the old app had an accurate "history" file so i was able to locate/access my links. The equilizer is gone also.,1,05/24/2019,34
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I LOVE vlc but atm the Parsing System is not playing well with my Essential Phone _  after a few deletes of mp3s it doesn't recognize new or updated files. I have to clear the App Storage not the Cache _  in order to fix the problem which ultimately resets my settings and I have to start a new.,2,03/25/2019,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,i really wanted to like this because i've used the PC version for 10+ years but this app is honestly trash. annoying unremovable splash tutorial every single time you open a file...having to reapply subtitles every time you minimise...video freezes and grey screen glitches for no apparent reason...completely unintuitive UI...obnoxiously time-consuming sliders for applying delays/syncs... and the worst: why does volume increase in increments of 6% and not 5%?! more than mildly infuriating. AVOID.,1,02/16/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,There is a glitch when I use the screen mirroring feature _  it ALWAYS starts blinking and does not connect _  I have to go back _  then try to play the movie again in order for it to work. Also _  it stops streaming on the screen mirroring any time i get a message or notification of any kind.,3,11/22/2018,3
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Overall an awesome app. Plays almost every type of media file. Great customization and functionality. Only thing that needs to be fixed _  and I hope the developers read this _  the sleep timer is no longer working. App is installed on an S9. Any suggestions?,5,04/20/2019,15
App884,org.videolan.vlc,love it but since last update whenever I pause a video _  go to another app _  then come back it freezes. I have to close the video and restart (figure out where I was up to). Fix it and I'll give you 5 starts. Thank you. thought this update did it but still not.,2,04/12/2019,46
App884,org.videolan.vlc,For years VLC has been my Go-To on phones and PC's alike. but lately everytime I attempt to play a video from my Samsung Galaxy Phone it shows the navigation arrows screen and shuts down... never playing the video. So _  I had to find another to try. Fix and I surely will reinstall.,3,05/30/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Hi I always choose VLC as my go to app for playing movies however it now has some glitch with my new phone when I exit the app without closing it and I open my tabs again and try and open it _  it doesn't allow me to. It just says vlcnis unable to open. Then I have to open the app all over again and search for the movie I was busy with. I also have to forward to part where I was.,2,06/07/2019,11
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I think this app will be perfect when you will add a "route audio to device" option for when you streaming to chromecast (for example) _  like Localcast has (wich is not a very good app _  unfortunately). So _  don't wait to much and implement this feature and i will give you a five star rating.,4,06/15/2019,27
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Used to work great. Then yesterday it would just keep stopping my playlist's songs after a few seconds _  refuse to accept inputs(pause/play/etc) from my Bluetooth headphones and overall unresponsive. Switched to a different media player _  everything works just fine with that so it wasn't a phone or headphone issue.,3,09/25/2019,12
App884,org.videolan.vlc,my only player _  both on a desktop and a mobile. audio compressor improves the audio quality and loudness . spot on . thank you very much... p.s. my only wish would be a pitch control _  cause it really helps when you are a guitarist or a singer . anyway thank you very much great stuff,5,07/01/2019,6
App884,org.videolan.vlc,VLC Player has _  for a long time _  been my go-to for use on Linux & Windows PCs. With a few (very rare) exceptions _  if it's out there _  VLC will play it. Since it became available on mobile devices _  the circle is complete. Install it—you'll love it!,5,07/26/2019,17
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I think regardless of the 0Day doom and gloom press that VideoLAN has gotten for the MacOS and Linux versions _  the fact is that it has still been an excellent program for well over ten years. The mobile version is no different _  and offers similarly excellent video playing software _  while still never wavering from their commitment to open-source software. Video players in the Play Store seem dominated by shady looking forks of OSS players. VLC and MX Player remain my reliable and trusted options.,5,08/08/2019,66
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Hands down own the best media player available. I just wish the recent update hadn't removed the ability to keep the audio playing for pop-up player while my device is locked. Now if I want to see the video after unlocking the device I need to play as audio and open it from there - A minor convenience in an otherwise excellent app.,5,08/15/2019,14
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I like this app and would give it 5 stars _  but on my phone (OnePlus 5) I can clear a playlist and if I draw the unpause gesture on the screen while my phone sleeps it starts playing from the playlist that was cleared. I've even cleared the play history and force closed the app and this still works. It's a deal breaker unfortunately _  but I would love to reinstall VLC if this gets fixed.,4,09/10/2019,25
App884,org.videolan.vlc,This app is a perfect fit for the audio of movies _  musics and things what ever you are using believe me you will love it _  But I've been using this app quite in a while _  So i can't say anything bad about this app _  but the only thing i know is that it solved my problem. And I'm thankful and happy for that matter.,5,09/19/2019,305
App884,org.videolan.vlc,One of my favorite app. I've been using this aap for some years on my mobile and laptop and have found no issues so far. Tried other apps but wasn't satisfied with them. VLC the best app and I recommend other users to give it a try. They won't be disappointed. Giving 4 stars because there's always room for new features and improvements.,4,10/21/2019,482
App884,org.videolan.vlc,There used to be a arrow like icon on the right hand side of vlc which was really helpful for casting the video on tv but no it's not there what happened,2,12/25/2019,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,7i was just getting to my point when my rating was closed...My issue is that I don't want anybody access to mypersonal text or call. If the access you require is for other reasons which I don't understand _  please SOMEONE explain to me how the access is used,4,01/13/2020,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,App is great but it needs some improvement like if we play a song without enable time stretching audio and increase its playback speed then audio got destroyed and facing too many noise while playing audio _  improve it so that we can play song too in fast playback speed without changing pitch. I hope you will be improve this as early as possible otherwise it deserve five star rating.,3,11/15/2019,9

App884,org.videolan.vlc,Simplly brilliant! Everything just works really well ...and beautifully too. Ive not yet found a file format it wont play. It works well in the background. Audio fedelity seems good to my (admittedly untrained) ear. No annoying advertising. Absolutely perfect!,5,02/16/2019,5
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Pretty unstable lately and buggy af every time I use it recently. Doesn't play well with some videos but the rest work fine. Need to be wary of which compression has been used on the video I guess. Shame it has bever been an issue before and VLC has been my go to player on most platforms for well over a decade.,3,11/28/2018,7
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Good job with a broken update. Now I can no longer cast to any devices _  which already was pretty sketchy to begin with. Also the app never seems to stay open in the background when media is paused _  regardless of power settings.,1,04/12/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Not very stable. On a road trip _  I was trying to play an audiobook (mp3 version). Kept crashing and couldn't restart where it left-off. It only remembered the start of the audiobook _  not where it was when it crashed.,3,12/07/2018,3
App884,org.videolan.vlc,The only reason why I installed this is to play .mkv files. Issue: it could be either late visuals or fast audio/ subtitle.

These being said it's still the best and most comprehensive player app available.,4,09/12/2018,24
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Works fine . But since last update  _  the speed adjustment is altered in such a way that it has become a little bit difficult to reach the option if you might wanna increase  _  also one must re enter required speed each time he opens the app .,4,05/05/2019,3
App884,org.videolan.vlc,the beta was much better because you could speed up songs and heighten the pitch but this version just skips when you try to play it sped up _  how is the beta better than this version yet that's the one that's gets the plug pulled on it? very disappointed.,1,04/13/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,when i turn my phone to go from portrait view to landscape view..... video player goes into p-i-p mode and restarts the video which is very irritating...... also the resume playback sometimes works sometimes not there is no option for folder view.... had very bad experience.... uninstalling,1,03/10/2019,3
App884,org.videolan.vlc,It has got everything I wanted. I specially like the audio and video library system and the eq. Edit: Problems with controls are back. They are now buried under android controls(home _ back etc.) again. And ability to boost volume in audio only files would be nice. I am on android pie.(android one),3,07/19/2019,21
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I used VLC on my laptop since 2005 always worked flawlessly _  my only issue is using it on Pie _  every single time I pause what I am watching it stops working _  ir closes _  freezes and I need to open the file again to proceed to watch again and find the exact poin I was watching _  please consider on review it and fix _  thanks in advance.,1,06/04/2019,2
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I can't play a video twice _  for the first time is ok but when I try to play the same video again _  it opens and closes the app _  fix it please _  but I like the features like controls the brightness in the screen,3,04/04/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,As functional as the original VLC. So it is buggy but will play most/all video not necessarily completely correct. Includes NEW additional bugs and missing features special for android partially due to android. Broken joke. Casting is nonfunctional only able to use one screen making in video menus useless.,2,10/19/2018,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Video does not play when i switch back to the app from exiting. This does not happen prior the recent update. i have been using vlc for a long time _  and this is the first time i have experienced problems with this app.,1,04/23/2019,6
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Very simple and easy to control music app. I like the fact that I can switch from video to audio and back. The only thing that I miss though I used to hate it but now I miss is when used to insert earphones or connect with bluetooth the VLC would automatically start playing _  please developers return this feature.,5,08/30/2019,21
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Is there a way to build a Playlist in VLC without having to play each song or video? Am I missing something? Would be great to have option buttons in the playlist and search views to put put them into playlists _  queues _  or even play next. Also A-B Playback doesn't work. Other notifications cancel VLC playback _  though keeps playing. Thank you for making VLC on Android. However it is frustrating to use until fixed.,5,06/14/2019,55
App884,org.videolan.vlc,my experience with this app is good it can do other stuff that some other app can't do .but sometimes when you download your music it doesn't automatically go to the music icon quickly enough sometimes you afto wait a day or night before it gets there ... which is kind of annoying because you want to listen to your music same time.But otherwise than that the app is good 👍🤩🤩🤩😍😍💕,5,06/19/2019,5
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Best player full stop. My only gripe is that I cannot get it to function with Android Auto no matter what build of the app I use. I heard functionality was supposed to come back in 3.1 _  apparently not? Will give 5 stars if an answer is given.,2,07/02/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,advanced options suggestions: 1. if volume key "single press" - volume change 2. if volume key "double press" - song next 3. if triple press - 10 second seek. This will be useful when mobile in pocket and control by headset or Bluetooth volume keys. 4. when finger is slowly swiped over paused screen _  the frame should change immediately without need of lifting the finger. Pls Do it.,4,07/31/2019,15
App884,org.videolan.vlc,When playing video as audio in the background the app will frequently lose the audio file when app is reopened _  with the file needing to be opened again from another app (in this case Evernote) and started from scratch again. Very frustrating when trying to take notes from lectures/recordings _  which involves flicking between VLC and other apps.,1,08/20/2019,175
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I don't know what's wrong with this app I've been using it for many years no issues and then out of the blue the last couple of months it just started deleting pictures videos music rearranging it ...I use Showbox and for some reason it deleted about 20 videos today but now I can't find or use and I try to download it again and it won't even show it..,1,08/31/2019,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,its a pretty decent app _  i like a lot of its functions but it pisses me off a lot too _  like it will stay on my bar like i have something plaing when i don't even when i remove the notification _  or the worst and most annoying thing is if i leave the app and have it play in the background _  if i press play again it will send me to a completely different file and video _  and if i go back to the video i was watching even if i was like halfway through and have the setting that saves the time it restarts,3,08/30/2019,328
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Worse than Kodi. Unable to maintain a consistent framerate. Discards arbitrary key frames _  leaving badly corrupted video. Unusually poor performance for 16-bit YCbCr 4:4:4 1080p.,1,12/19/2019,2
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Love the PC app _  this one choked on my big memory card and 200meg audio files. Tried it twice. But am not a typical user. To be fair _  several other well-known music apps did the same. Just wanted to make sure folks with the same configuration knew. When it plays it's great,3,11/11/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,There is a lack of subtitle options. I'm not looking for anything crazy _  but I couldn't even change the size. I know there is a size option but it didn't do the trick. MX Player's "scaling" option worked fine. Not to mention they have way more subtitle options.,4,10/03/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Best Music Player for me. Includes Pitch Shifting (key change) at 0.5x and 1x which spices up the musical experience for me,5,12/10/2019,11

App884,org.videolan.vlc,this app was really good last year _  I'm not sure if it's the new phone _  emui os _  android pie or an update _  but the picture in picture has gone crazy buggy and the video will skip back a few seconds or to the beginning when rotating. it's difficult to use now.,2,01/03/2019,3
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I love this app! Watching my shows on it _  they look better. Best of all _  the App. plays them in order! No more exiting and clicking on the next episode. I almost didn't get it! What a mistake that would have been 😁,4,04/16/2019,10
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Was really enjoying using this but recently videos that I've tried to play have just been freezing with the audio still playing (no it's not the files fault) and sometimes it forgets my place in the video I'm watching if I pause it for too long. Better than my inbuilt video player but certainly has some issues.,3,11/15/2018,5
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I've loved the VLC player for years. The Android app is great. However _  I can load subtitles on my cell when watching a movie _  but I cannot load the same subtitles on my tv through the Google Chromecast. That is why I won't give it 5 stars.,4,11/18/2018,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,A few changes were made recently _  and it's definitely throwing me off. Playlists are in their own separate section _  but I can get used to it. It annoys me that I can't reorder songs in a premade playlist _  though.,4,04/28/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,If you minimize the application to read messages _  or even if you turn the display of and off _  the application yill keep closing itself until you restart the phone. It's a shame  _ because it's the only app that plays really any video...,1,03/02/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Very poor performance. inconsistent results. Frequent disconnections. Frustrating and cumbersome. This app is equally as bad as the desktop version is good. Search for other methods; do not use this app.,2,04/07/2019,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,It's good that it plays soft subs _  but there's a time that when I download a new movie or video it ain't refreshing the library _  and the old videos that are deleted are still there. Please fix your app.,3,12/23/2018,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Sleep timer broken since you changed from the popup icons to a list menu. Please fix it. Edit: kinda works now but its buggy. If player is stopped by sleep timer you have to force close vlc to play anything again. Also would be nice to see how long is left on the timer either by notification or in the menu as it did previously.,1,05/22/2019,47
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I have enjoyed VLC ever since i started using it. maybe _  the latest version just needs to have the auto stop and play function restored when the headphone jack is inserted or removed. it was a simple feature that worked great. cheers,5,03/14/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Stopped crashing when changing screen orientation _  good. and now subtitles don't load anymore _  even when they are in the same folder than the movie. Another regression in a series of regressions after years without bumps.. what's happening? :(,3,03/14/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Would have given it a 5 star rating until the last video I tried to play on it wouldn't play. The screen would just flash and then go back to main screen I had to use another app just to play it...the PC version has always supported every video format so this is a big disappointment for me.,3,08/11/2019,128
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Something is really weird about the audio and picture sync when bluetooth headphones are used. The subtitle overlaid would sync perfectly _  but the picture may be 10ms faster than both the audio and the subtitle. if would have made more sense if the subtitle and thr picture is in sync ...,2,02/15/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I have been using VLC Player (Desktop) a decade but for android also _  VLC provide a fully loaded suit for watchers _  etc. that want to see just movies _  videos _  etc. The thing i like most about the VLC is its UI and the playback quality but i request vlc team to add video quality range to set video quality during in streams (Must add this one) as well as generate auto generated subtitles ( If it is Possible) during in streams and also the History Panel must contain the history of streamed video.,5,11/13/2019,513
App884,org.videolan.vlc,gr8 application... after checking lots of things i found out 2 flaws. 1. cant adjust video per second _  i.e minimum 3 second change is given. its ok to adjust 1 second change. 2. the equlizer is out of date improve that. xplayer can beat you in equlizer. you guys do beat them in audio but not video,4,04/29/2019,3
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Great sound quality _  smooth interface. Best all around music (media) player on the App Store. Only complaint is that every once in a while it "Parses" for media way too long. I have over 32gb of music _  so maybe it's my fault...but very annoying.,3,03/11/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Works better on Chromecast _  a Google product _  than Google Play Music _  which requires that you first upload your MP3's. Works better at Bluetooth audio than Google Play Music _  because I always have to manually kickstart Google Play Music to start playing. Less bloated than other players.,5,01/29/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Would be amazing but this app seems to have issues with displaying shared media files from my pc. My pc will have X amount of files in a single shared folder but VLC will only show half of them. Not much i can do within VLC app since the options are so barebones. Please fix this issue. Its the same issue with the other "green" version of VLC,3,05/09/2019,1367
App884,org.videolan.vlc,The deleted music files still show up in the vlc song list. It shows deleted when I try to play it though. Refreshing the list also doesnt help. New files also don't show up in the list sometimes. I have to browse the directory to play it.,3,04/02/2019,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,the shuffle is absolutely brutal . i have 1200 songs and can click shuffle 100 times and it very rarely picks any other songs besides the A _  B _  C _  D _  and E category songs . would be nice if it would truely shuffle thru my music instead of just being lazy and playing same songs over and over and over again .,1,04/26/2019,8
App884,org.videolan.vlc,App only plays audio for 30 or so seconds when in the background or when the screen is locked _  Pretty annoying if I am wanting to browse other apps while listening to music _  is there a fix for this issue? I can only see settings for background video playback which isnt what I am after.,1,01/28/2019,4
App884,org.videolan.vlc,The audio and video files stored on my SD card do not show in the Media Library even though the location folders are selected. What's good though is that I can put the folders in the Directories tab so I could easily access it. But still I hope my media files on the SD Card get recognized automatically.,4,06/03/2019,78
App884,org.videolan.vlc,media library nightmare. used to LOVE this app. it can never find my music. it's laggy. it's a pain. i preferred it over google play. i stopped using it...because its always broken...works a week (so i switch from play...create my playlists again)...and broke after another week. what a shame...used to be amazing. save yourself a huge headache. this thing needs rewrote.,1,06/08/2019,944
App884,org.videolan.vlc,It's playing a video that my Samsung video player wouldn't load. it's awesome _  no one wants to download a torrent file n not be able to play it after the effort. only struggle is my brightness can't be altered on the video _  that's a bit annoying _  because I need to find a dark cupboard to watch it in.,4,06/09/2019,41
App884,org.videolan.vlc,i have VLC for many computers and it works great. On the phone _  not so much... It just keeps crashing most of the time rarely working _  though _  it also plays my avi files. The crashing has got to be fixed asap. Even restarting my phone did not fix the problem.,4,05/31/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I love that it will play in the background on my Android tablet with controls in my notifications dropdown screen. This way I can study a book with music in the background. Love it and have used it on a Mac for years before Android now too.,5,06/13/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,The latest version sucked _  to put it simply. v4.x not only does not refresh the list even if is's done manually I would end up losing all my video's thumbnails as well. The only way to fix it is to go back to v2.3.1 or earlier. Oh _  how I longed for provision of NO stars at all if there is such a thing!,1,09/18/2019,664
App884,org.videolan.vlc,This app is killing my phone. When i open vlc it start for scanning for media files ( I can't stop this scanning) _  and my phone hanged and restart each time when i open this app and watch a movie ( I only tried 3 times). My phone hanged like it is infected with a wrost virus. I played pubg and other games but i never feel a lag before. I am using Honor 8X. I used vlc before i never feel anything like this . If i download this from some where else i would really think it is dangerous virus.,1,09/25/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I am loving this app because it plays all sorts of video formats available on the internet. But I would five it 3* as while playing some content which has been saved in a location and i don't open that content from gallery or dile explorer or If I get a call  _  there are no resume capabilities and I have to start it again,3,07/06/2019,34
App884,org.videolan.vlc,It is my fav media player. It's features are excellent. But please you should fix the fact that the Sort By resets to Name everytime the app is restarted. Make it save the Sort By state... Because I prefer using Sort By Date but it stresses me to have to change every time I open the app,4,07/14/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,VLC has been my go-to video player for years but recently i've encountered severe audio stuttering from the video i downloaded from my car dashcam (.MOV format) to show to authorities. I tried playing it on other android media player app and it was just fine. Good thing i had it as a back-up. Please fix the audio stuttering.,3,07/29/2019,9
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I really like the app but there is no function to let the video autoplay from the last video in the app back to the first video. It is really disappointing as I thought this app can do what other apps can't. Until the issue is fixed _  my rating will stay 1 🌟 for now.,1,10/27/2019,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,The best free video player out there _  bar none. It has it's own built in codecs _  so there's no messing around wondering what you need to play specific file types. This handles them all. I haven't found anything that it won't play yet. it might not have as many features as some of the other players out there _  but it gets the job done _  and at the end of the day _  that's all that matters. Awesome!,5,08/04/2019,7

App884,org.videolan.vlc,Great player _  smooth ui and allows screen off during chromecast to conserve some battery. Had to update this review since finding an issue. VLC will not find new videos even after pull down and tapping refresh from top corner. All other players such as MX _  Xplayer and stock Samsung video player all update and show new video just fine so it must be a glitch on VLC.,2,09/20/2019,15
App884,org.videolan.vlc,The new update removed all the sorting features. Sorting by name descending or ascending when looking through all my recorded videos doesn't help me at all. I renamed all my old ones with one or two words to remind me of what they were _  but I need chronological sort _  so I can get to my lab videos quicker on my biweekly updates.,1,12/05/2019,46
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Used to be a great app. Now _  after a fresh install _  under Android 8.0 _  music keeps in shutting off - On unpredictable intervals. All of the latest updates are installed.

App884,org.videolan.vlc,The app still can't play a cue sheet accompanying a .wav file! It shows the list of songs _  but no matter which song you click on _  it starts over from the beginning of wav.

VLC CONTINUES TO DELETE MY PLAYLISTS AND REARRANGE SONGS IN MY PLAYLISTS. & I CAN'T rearrange the songs in my playlists:( & this app won't sync soundtracks to the videos. NICE 15 sec DELAY.

Currently searching for a better RELIABLE APP!!! WORTHLESS!!!,1,12/05/2019,21
App884,org.videolan.vlc,The app is so boring when it comes to track's name _  I have an audio track in my device and it have its name _  but I tried to search it in the player the player didn't find it _  I came to realize it is written track 4 while I know ut exact name. Fix this or you add a section to edit track's details.,1,05/15/2019,29
App884,org.videolan.vlc,This is my media player of choice and has been for years but now for some reason when getting out of the app now there is loading notification that doesnt go away unless you completely shut down the app??

App884,org.videolan.vlc,Amazing video and music player that as a result of it having a fair amount of customisability and enabling users to have a significant freedom in what they do it has now replaced samsung music and the samsung video player which have in time degraded to a cluster of inconsistency and annoyance meanwhile making me wait for their terrible index update scheduel to be able to access my content,5,05/08/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,VLC is already an established name for video players and I like the wide customization options. I just hope it saves the sort settings I set and not have to constantly change whenever I open it _  it really gets annoying over time. Can we also have a version that is just solely for videos and no music player? I find the music player unnecessary and just taking up large storage.,2,02/05/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,The sap lot of different file formats and that's really great. The controls are a little bit wonky in that It has very few features and controls for playing the movie. However it is the right price.,2,03/20/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I have used this for a long time and won't use it again . too many times it jumps the volume to the loudest setting even if I don't touch the volume button no matter what I do or how i set the app or my computer it's been responsible for too many head akes....,2,01/03/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,this is still the best player _  I use on pc now on my Galaxy s10 plus. Chromecast is a breeze. no adds etc. plays off the OTG just great. no need for other players..there really isn't question VLC.. does it play H265..? .had a bit of trouble. I know it plays H264. if not _  please update ALL formats as this player is just the best. Bless ya Helena xo,5,04/22/2019,80
App884,org.videolan.vlc,This app is nice except for one anoying thing " when i'm enjoying my song _  if a call comes in _  the app stops the music and it doesn't resume the song after the call _  and it doesn't allow you to continue the song after the call. The app shuts down",4,05/17/2019,15
App884,org.videolan.vlc,It used to work well before ..but now days it has numerous flaws...it fails to update the latest movies when downloaded or acquired ...it doesn't delete movies completely ..promotes cluttering ! One has to delete and download a frsh for it to function normally.,1,04/30/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,i love this app _  best android video player _  been using it since my first android experience... i just have few tips. 1-please add sort by DATE to videos. 2- subtitles files don't work often. 3- albums category in music should add the tracks to their own album not separated that i find hundreds of albums. 4-some mkv videos might crash and result to not being able to play them ever again unless i reset the app cache.,5,04/15/2019,23
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Well it's the best no doubt... but it needs some little updates... after sorting by folders it should also allow me to sort by date...And one more thing when video is played midway... when played in audio mode get it start from start... please do the same... Please... I am in need of it...,4,04/12/2019,16
App884,org.videolan.vlc,When i pause the video and lock the screen and restart it again theres No Sound _  dosnt load subtitles from streaming apps auto subtitles search is broken when i start streaming or watching local video the player always starts with 0 brightness (even if its not showing zero the screen is at its darkest) i have to adjust it every time i start the player _  dosnt play some video formats i use this player now only cause this one can Fill my entire screen unlike MX Player,3,03/23/2019,71

App884,org.videolan.vlc,The only video app thay casts videos through chromecast and i have sound everytime. Other android apps that i use with chromecast in 70% of the videos they are casted without sound. VLC casts great but the only downside is that subtitles cant be casted on the screen. For that 4 stars ... i hope we will have this option soon :),4,05/25/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,used to be excellent. now its a flip of a coin whether it will play a file or not. only llays the first 30 seconds of songs. crashes randomly. remote controls in notification area keep casting songs to tv when im trying to cast with other apps.,1,05/25/2019,4
App884,org.videolan.vlc,One of the few video apps on the Google Play Store which is actually has good user interface and supports playing many video formats. The only issue I have is I cannot disable the music player part of the app _  which sometimes launches itself when I want to play my music through Poweramp.,4,03/19/2019,3
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Worthless POS. Has gone downhill with every update. Looses place and requires reloading the file if the audio is paused for any length of time. Landscape mode no longer has the ability to use the full screen for more accurate time scrolling. Findings are consistent on two Tab S4s _  Note 8 _  Note 9 and a Tab S2.,1,05/10/2019,27
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Your app use to be good until your last update! Now it won't read all the music that it did before. Won't read any new music uploaded or i've chosen for playlist! Hell it basically does whatever it wants. Will be looking for a new media player.,1,04/18/2019,21
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Was a wonderful audio player _  but has been updated to no longer be useful for me. Pausing for almost any length of time will lose your place and reset the player so you'll need to hunt down where you were listening from _  horrible If you listen to podcasts or audiobooks.,3,01/24/2019,3
App884,org.videolan.vlc,make the album art uncut from above and bottom for a square picture cut in rectangular looks really bad. fix the bug that sometimes turns off songs. fix the bug that the scanning process starts too often (up to 3 times a day!) and takes really long,5,05/29/2019,5
App884,org.videolan.vlc,top app for me for years now on my tv an then on mobiles so easy to use and has all the connexions codes if it hasnt which i find hard to imagine they havent got them all is because new things coming out all the time but VLC loads by itself a new code if not reconised in its genepool shal i say. it does i T right away so no waing all day or till nxt day its done straight away. thanks for reading my side of things..,5,04/12/2019,114
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Since this last update I haven't been able to play a single track. No _  that's not quite right. I haven't been able to play more than 0.0000000001% of a single track. I'm not ready to delete the app yet _  as I'm hoping you all will resolve these issues _  but this sucks because this is the only media app that I've used for years.,1,05/04/2019,7
App884,org.videolan.vlc,It's a great app but there are two big issues for me. The first is that when using Chromecast you can't put subtitles. The second one it's pretty recent _  for some reason they removed the ability to close the app from the lock screen quick menu.,3,04/03/2019,36
App884,org.videolan.vlc,The latest update has made this app very slow and annoying. Scanning for music now takes forever _  the app hangs _  it very sad because I've loved vlc and used it for a long time _  I especially liked that it played practically all formats. I'm disappointed and I had to change my music player,2,06/10/2019,18
App884,org.videolan.vlc,This app will play multiple videos back to back without needing my help selecting the next video and needing to hit play afterwards. The best video player for Android all the way around. i have tried at least 10 other apps _  and the VLC app is definitely my favorite.,5,06/10/2019,6
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Good but There are still a lot of fix needed. I have new videos I download on my phone but it does not show in VLC even after refreshing it. It does not show my new videos. Which is very annoying. You guys need to fix it. I switched to MX player today. So until you guys fix your app ain't gonna use it.,4,09/04/2019,19
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Really good app. Ability to touch screen to forward _  rewind and pause makes it unique. And also _  one can minimise a video into the background and use his phone for other functions while the video continues playing; that's excellent.,5,06/29/2019,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,it's really a nice app and have been using this in windows for many years where as in app or andriod it's difficult to forward a bit or few seconds or mins it's not possible like windows you can press shift+side arrow keys..please add forward and backward options.. still we can able to do it but not that much effective..thank you so much and appreciate your efforts..,5,07/31/2019,7

App884,org.videolan.vlc,I have always used this application and it is the best. however _  lately when playing a track it keeps stopping on its own. I am reinstalling the app hoping it fixes the problem. Will change my review when it is fixed.,1,07/29/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Does not work with Oppo reno z in portrait mode _  the taskbar of the phone is on top of the play _  playback _  forward.... buttons of vlc. It rotates movies even when my rotation on phone is turned off. (So does the phones own software which I don't want). Love the app for PC though.,2,07/30/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I downloaded this app because my new phone's app does not support wma files.For years I have spent my hard earned money lovingly collecting my favourite albums _  and now I can't listen to 90% of my music collection.This app works fine except...the sound during playback (speakers and headphones) comes in "pulses".The sound decreases and increases again to the normal levels at regular "pulsing" intervals throughout the song.On any wma file _  mp3 files are not affected!I tried reinstalling.No good.,1,08/06/2019,11
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Buggy _  the swipe skip sometimes not working properly. If i quit the app while in a folder _  then back again it'll show the app's home screen but actually inside a folder _  so it confuses me every time because i can't touch anything and realized i was actually in a folder that the screen didn't show so i have to press back and then open the folder again so it showing properly. Idk if it was my phone _  but i think it's not.,3,09/28/2019,663
App884,org.videolan.vlc,VLC Works Fantastic Even tho i have a default video player built in i prefer to use this application cuz of touch gestures from skipping _ fast forwarding _ volume and brightness is an amazing control! It even support Dark mode.Been using it for years and I'd have to say it's an amazing application I'm on a 64bit device and i found out in settings it was only on 16bit So that the video quality is a little Washed out or low quality but faster in skipping i hope u optimize it for 64bit device s,5,11/22/2019,12

App884,org.videolan.vlc,No support for the latest SMB protocols is a dealbreaker. I'm not going to leave my PC vulnerable just to use VLC to access music on it remotely... which is kind of a big part of the application for me. Shame _  because it's otherwise good.,3,12/17/2018,32

App884,org.videolan.vlc,Normally a very awesome app _  but for the Android version it only understands files to play _  not DVDs anymore. Last time it barely could recognize that it was a DVD to play _  not a file _  and now it flatly refuses to treat DVDs as anything other than data files. Dang.,1,06/09/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Great app. Used for years. However _  through out the years _  Resume Playback has ALWAYS had issues. It'll work for weeks on end _  then up and quit working for who knows how long and restart the file at the beginning (for both audio and video).,4,09/10/2019,12
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I am extremely disappointed in VLC. I've been using it for sometime _  and lately the audio has become distorted and to make sure it isn't my phone's speakers. I also tried playing the same video from browser it's a shame how it turned out to be. I really liked it _  well all good things do come to end sooner or later.,1,09/19/2019,23
App884,org.videolan.vlc,The app is decent _  but they've made some lateral moves. My biggest complaint is the removal of the "resume" button. This feature was crucial for listening to audiobooks on my phone. I really _  really hope they add this feature back in a future update.,3,06/17/2019,14
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Good media player _  one issue though _  when i try to play .flac audio files _  they don't show up directly from within the app when i go to the folder in the app _  but I'm able to go to the same file in my file manager _  load VLC player through the file manager _  and play these .flac files.,4,07/04/2019,384
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I have preferred to use this app on my laptop for years and I am not alone. Now that apple is has discontinued any video app I am seeing all the superior qualities of the good to great Android devices. No need for the clunky obese iTunes. I no longer wear a frown when someone says apple is sh**. VLC is the best. Used throughout in colleges and library. This product of the free software foundation has gone from strength to strength.,5,07/15/2019,65
App884,org.videolan.vlc,This really is 1st Top Best Music Player in the world _  and its VLC. Due to updates of GPlay Music _  I can't scan my music anymore because all permissions are directed to the new system of 5.1 and Up. KitKat without the latest 64 capabilities doesn't have the ability to give permission to Media Files/Storage _  I am using Samsung GTab 9.6E. I was in a slump _  tried every Mp3Players out there and nothing really works. I also used VLC in my desktop and its a wonderful player for my everyday playlists!!,5,07/17/2019,7
App884,org.videolan.vlc,It is possible to have an option on the very beginning to dismiss all the mandatory tutorials everywhere in the app for ever?

Thanks :) Of course five stars because its VLC.,5,10/25/2019,19
App884,org.videolan.vlc,This app was great but unfortunately there is only one dissapointment for me is when i seek a part of video _  sometime the sound frequency kinda worst...

App884,org.videolan.vlc,the wiget finally works for me. the app no longer seems to need to find my music files stored on my sd card before playing them everytime i start the app. at least that was the case the day of the update a day ago. now the app won't find the music on my sd card _  so now this app is useless for me,1,04/10/2019,21
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Automatic subtitles download doesn't work anymore (and hasn't been in a few months tbh). Also _  if you close the app and then try to come back _  it crashes and then you have to reset the video and try to find where you left off manually. Used to be great tho,2,11/09/2019,7

App884,org.videolan.vlc,Just switched from a Galaxy S7 Edge to a Pixel 3 XL - honestly didn't realize how much functionality I lost from Samsung's UI to stock Android but the worst thing was that a lot of my music files were either missing info or album art (or straight-up couldn't play consistently) on Hash Music player or Google Play music. Though the UI could use some work as far as playlist creation goes (bulk adding songs to playlists would be nice) only this app consistently played all my songs/showed all info.,4,11/19/2019,3

App884,org.videolan.vlc,Great app _  love it. But when I use VLC to delete a video from my phone _  it still shows in my library. Rescanning my phone still leaves it there. The only way to get it to disappear is to wipe the data of the app and scan again.,3,02/05/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,VLC is the best! it recognizes almost any file type. It is simple and no nonsense with all of the stuff you want and none of the fluff. i am especially happy that it recognizes and plays my voice recorder files (android os). Excellent app! thank you!,5,05/13/2019,49
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Perfect except for one thing: the subtitle delay changes by only 50ms when you press the buttons. So if you want to change 20 seconds _  you need to click 400 times! And that is VERY annoying on my remote control for my Android TV. Please fix this!,5,05/18/2019,2
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Sir your VLC player is wonderful _  you have given an extraordinary player with amazing controls. My idea is that to provide audio frequency controler in your VLC player. Sir in some scenes like in fighting scenes or songs volume would be more and in sentimental scenes volume would be less. To adjust it we need to increase or decrease volume manually. Instead if you add audio frequency controler in your player it would control the audio range automatically.,5,01/13/2019,62
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Just upgraded it and the whole good experience I had with it turned worse _  I cant help it but to delete. Though I have invested a lot of time and money on the game...

App884,org.videolan.vlc,This update broke the player. It's slow _  doesn't load files properly and the rss stream is not working at all anymore. The only reason I have vlc is to stream podcast and now I can't. Was working great but not anymore after update. Fix and I'll give 5 stars,1,04/30/2019,2
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I like it _  but it does not play all my music. When I select certain songs to play _  after a few seconds it will skip to a different song with no explanation. I wish it would at least tell me why it can't play the song.,2,05/05/2019,2
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Great media player _  but the Chromecast feature is really buggy. More often than not _  the icon doesn't even appear to allow casting. All my other apps are casting fine _  so it isn't a fault on my end. Will happily give 5 stars if this gets fixed.,3,10/26/2018,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,This is an essential application _  why haven't you downloaded it yet? There is a small issue of high resolution artwork (my images are 1400x1400 pixels) looking pixelated on the track/album thumbnails _  on the main player screen _  and on the lockscreen background. Keep up the great work VLC team!,5,07/03/2019,6
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Good app till the new update when everything moved and now i have to go searching through the files and app to find most of my music which is stored on an SD card. I cant access any of them from the opening screen (album/track/artist/genre) which is making the app frustrating to use.,3,04/23/2019,17
App884,org.videolan.vlc,It plays all videos but stability is awful _  phone slows and freezes because app crashes a lot. I have used this for years its always had issues like the one i described. Auto rotate is a fail also it doesn't match your phones setting. Does anybody even read these reviews?,2,04/18/2019,14
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Used to be a great app. One day it stopped being able to see videos on my phone. I've reinstalled it maybe half a dozen times in the last six months _  and it always gets stuck on parsing media 17%. How do I give negative stars?!?,1,01/02/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,fantastic but there is problem here that we can not fast forward it and also i like this app because it is very easy to use and we can watch movie in good quality i am glad to tell you that this app really helps in entertainment but can you can add a feature for downloading movies in it for free,5,04/27/2019,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Such a frustrating app to use. Sometimes it works great and sometimes we'll be halfway through streaming something to Chromecast and it will start getting glitchy _  then give up altogether. And you can't even get it working again after that. So annoying.,2,09/29/2018,8
App884,org.videolan.vlc,it's a nice music app but Its so annoying now I have uninstall the app just so my new music can be read by it. there are times where when I hit shuffle it shows only 6 songs on my playlist when I have over 400. these glitches need to be fixed. ASAP,3,05/02/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Been using this app for a very2 long time and is very helpful too _  I'd still say it's the best media player... BUT latest update SUCKS! Videos won't work on split screen anymore _  volume wouldn't go beyond 100% anymore and app crashes a lot more than before.,3,11/06/2018,8
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Have been casting for several weeks. Recently _  casting symbol disappeared. Very frustrating. Reinstalling VLC did not solve the problem _  but restarting the phone did...the casting symbol magically reappeared. Other than that _  the app works well.,4,11/11/2018,6
App884,org.videolan.vlc,It plays a lot of media _  unfortunately when playing music and leave it in background it will not remember the last played song or folder _  you must select again and again even if you do not actually close the app... Annoying. Great equaliser though.,2,12/18/2018,4
App884,org.videolan.vlc,New update is awful. The app became very unstable _  I frequently encounter gliches and bugs. It's almost impossible during playback to put the app into background and come back - I always encounter blank black screen and have to restart VLC.,2,04/11/2019,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Great App. 1 fix: The screen times out too quickly when casting to chromecast. Does not happen when screen casting. Needs an option to stay on or off or delay PLEASE. Thats the only issue i have with this app... Been using on pc for years. Love it _  thanks.,5,05/17/2019,13
App884,org.videolan.vlc,The new version is bad for notched devices _  unlike the previous version this version also uses the space behind the notch. Meaning some contents of the video is hidden by the notch. The previous version is way better cause it blacks out the notch.,3,05/18/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,You have the best player for android _  no doubt here. I found a peculiar bug though — if one deletes the video and then starts other _  stream becomes unseeqable and app nonresponsive. Please _  investigate if its not planned behavior. 5 stars anyway.,5,05/31/2019,2
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I love watching films with this app. It's simple _  it has all features I need. Like the subtitles downloader etc... The music player is good but I don't use it for listening to music. Just to watch films and serials that I have in my phone. Love it!,4,06/19/2019,9
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I can openly say that "This is the best media app". Apps like Mx player forget what it is made to do and showing ads here and there. VLC is a clean looking platform which stick to what it is made to do and improving drastically. Its beta is mind-blowing with new UI. Thanks devs for doing a great job.,5,07/20/2019,48
App884,org.videolan.vlc,VLC does not or cannot cast to audio-only devices with one's own local network namely to Yamaha R-N803 musicast _  Linksys Range Extenders with analog audio ports (RE6500/6700) whereas its competitors NeutronMP _  AllConnect&Hi-Fi cast can cast to both video&audio receiving devices. I was informed by VLC engineers that VLC will not have any plans to support casting to audio only devices other than Chromecast Audio which itself has problems if there is no internet connection. NOT universal after all.,1,08/16/2019,8
App884,org.videolan.vlc,The mobile version not as good as the desktop one but it's by far the most feature-packed. It can play a varity of formats. And it also have options to download subtitles _  stream videos by using link and some other stuffs. Vlc is in the forefront of the multi-media app.,5,08/12/2019,8
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Screen dims automatically after 5 seconds or so _  it's annoying as hell especially when it's the only problem. Can't you fix it? It's needs to be fixed asap. Otherwise it's very much near perfect for what it does. Again _  the automatic screen dimming pisses me off!,4,10/28/2019,29
App884,org.videolan.vlc,It's a very good and valuable app _  but needs fixing few things. Whenever I receive a call when VLC is playing _  the VLC player switches off and disappears. I need to restart the whole thing once I hang up the call. If this is fixed it's a wonderful player.,2,09/02/2019,14
App884,org.videolan.vlc,The Audio player doesn't work properly in my phone (open SL ES ) .i mean i have FLAC tracks but i couldn't enjoy them because i frequently find artifacts... Quality is good and the FLACs are authentic but i get these annoying artifacts .. that's it want you to fix it.. Please .. humble request 😊 Otherwise the apps is spectacular.,5,09/07/2019,24
App884,org.videolan.vlc,VLC does it all and handles my very large collection of ripped music CDs with ease. I use it almost daily to play music over Bluetooth in my car. Pauses automatically when I get out and starts playing again automatically when I get back in. Phone never even comes out of my pocket.,5,12/01/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Using your finger to swipe through timeline is dumb. Everytime I wanna check my status bar it scans the video. The lock feature is a pain to keep turning on and off. Should have option to use only a traditional slide bar instead. And now adds popping up it's time for me to move on. I remember when free really did mean free,2,10/08/2019,10
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Please re-add the unscreen controls like the Volume _  Fast Forward _  Backward and Brightness. That will be wonderful. Thanks,5,12/16/2019,2
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Pls insert the language changeing options very worst compare to MX player,2,12/27/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,The old UI was much better and the new version is very buggy.,5,12/19/2019,2
App884,org.videolan.vlc,No adds _  no irritation. Happy,5,12/31/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,it has to refresh for audios & videos each and every time and that is a bit hectic. better the 2016/17 version performed well,1,02/19/2020,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,The update ruined the app. After the app got updated I now have a problem where not all my files load and that was never a problem I had before the update,2,12/09/2019,5
App884,org.videolan.vlc,great eq fot audio needs and great video options ad well. very good for long time yet still striving to improve!!🙈🙉🙊,5,01/01/2020,0

App884,org.videolan.vlc,Yep. It's the best there is. Among any video player i mostly recommend this😍😍😍,5,03/15/2020,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Why is it that everytime i update VLC _  its even more buggy!,2,03/15/2020,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Why is VLC for Android taking so long to be downloaded but keep on reading.,5,04/05/2020,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,It is very good app...i love this app because it is so simple to use..and add free,5,05/15/2020,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,would have given 5 star but the app doesn't play mkv videos in slanted mode especially when subtitle folder is added. once the subtitle is disabled _  it begins to play perfectly in slanted mode. please look into this _  noriced it after last upsates. abd thus happens on andriod 9,4,04/21/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Its good but I have this issue with it where the media files I delete still appear as undeleted in the vlc app and only in the app whereas I cannot find them anywhere else _  and when I press on these files they appear as corrupted and I cannot delete these files in vlc as they specify some error and comeback,3,02/23/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Literally the only music player on the store that does what I needed. 5/5,5,05/27/2020,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,The way the internal storage videos is shown is really bad.. The list viewing of videos of MX Player is best.. so please the listing of media on the phone Folder Wise as it is in MX Player. Otherwise player is good but needs improvement in Hardware decoding..,2,01/21/2019,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,this is my fave app when playing/watching videos..the only thing I don't like about this is how the videos are arranged..when I download my fave episodes they are numbered..I just don't like that after number 1 comes 11 next to it _  isn't it supposed to be 2? or is there a way I can change this?,4,05/10/2019,1751
App884,org.videolan.vlc,One of the best Video Players in the market _  but I am having trouble with the Cast button _  it appears randomly _  i have to activate Chromecast home or Youtube Cast in the app _  then disconnect for the Cast button to appear in VLC _  couldnt you just put the button to be always present? or a option in the settings to turn it on manually. Also dislike i have to confirm delete.,2,07/15/2019,4
App884,org.videolan.vlc,it's ok. the video takes a second to find itself when you scrub ahead a few seconds _  and the screen starts off black everytime I play a new video. A great app on my desktop _  but not a fan of the mobile version.,2,05/20/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,ive used VLC as my go to on Mac _  PC and mobile for years... but suddenly on Android unusable. if i have to switch apps _  or pause anything .. it simply freezes. cant open anything _  can't continue watching _  only option is to close and try to find where i was before... shame.,2,04/27/2019,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Everytime I add new songs in storage _  it fails to find the new files (it sort of pretends to search when I touch refresh) until I uninstall VLC and reinstall it. Fortunately _  Rocket Player doesn't have this problem _  so I'll be using that for music _  as it is the best Android player at present.,1,05/11/2019,6
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I will give this app 5 stars if they fix the issue I'm having that makes the app un-useable. Whenever my cellphone screen isn't unlocked and on the now playing screen of VLC then the music pauses after a couple of seconds until you go back into the app. Please help by fixing and I will give 5 stars because all of the apps other functions work very well. 👍,2,01/14/2019,5
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Ridiculous! Takes loooong time to check for new files in library. And when it does _  it shows file download source as file name. I have so many movies and hence it is impossible to check which is the file I am looking for.,1,11/14/2018,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Always been a VLC fan _  the codecs _  user interface experience _  sound and equalizer controls _  playlist management _  instant brightness and volume control by quick touch response _  but I found one problem on Huawei phones _  the ability to have functional control on the lock screen,5,02/22/2019,5
App884,org.videolan.vlc,It's great user interface with unique layout. But _  crushes at times...and crunk-sound while playing music. I honestly believe in your ability to deliver to the best of your potential. It's a great app and I will always use it.,5,11/02/2018,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Still the best free media player on Playstore. Tried all the others _  they ALL spam you with ads and 'fake' updates _  which are just excuses to load the app with even more ads. VLC plays everything _  is easy to use ... and is the ONLY free media player on Playstore without ads.,5,10/30/2018,10
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Just fix the old version and stop messing with it you keep damaging the app by adding features it was all ready the best a very long time ago stop making useless updates that cause malfunctions if not fixed really soon im getting rid of VLC from all my phone's computers laptops and tablets like a lot of others are starting to because of your stupid changes and Iv bin using VLC for well over a decade I do not want to have to start using another app and forget about any more donations,1,12/02/2018,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Used to be the best player around _  but with the recent updates _  it just fails to play fullscreen _  due to some error in the way they have implemented fragments. If you have an older version _  keep it untill the issue is fixed!,2,04/17/2019,15
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Like the interface but 2 problems 1. It keeps forgetting the contents of my playlists _  and they take an age to create _  so it's very frustrating. 2. It doesn't seem to be possible to reorder a playlist.,3,10/18/2018,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,audio delay was the big standout feature for me. it is missing after update. we could match words to the people speaking _  but not now. maybe we could have that back. great app!,5,04/17/2019,8
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Absolutely perfect. The app has so many features _  and I challenge you to find a format it can't play! And you get all of this for absolutely free _  with no ads or IAPs! Thanks devs!,5,03/21/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,After the update: Interface usability downgraded _  decoding acceleration lags _  does not remember the last position of playback and audio stream/subtitles chosen _  screenfit bugs. The app works significantly worse _  even though I did not change any application's system preferences in android :(,3,04/26/2019,4
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I just have updated the app but when i search for my playlist i get a notification as ' vlc has stopped' i need a solution immediately. There is another problem as when i transfer some audio files in my phone the vlc don't show them untill i reinstall the app. I need solution fir both problems .,2,04/21/2019,18
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Awesome for listening to transferred old cd and tape recorder music! 4 stars because it doesnt support reading aiff metadata _  so songs don't populate by album or artist _  even if the files contain that information. Otherwise this is hands down the best app. no ads,4,01/18/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Good but... If you delete a file on your device VLC still keeps file in the App and does not let you remove from library even though the file no longer exists. Aside from this odd issue it is perfect. I had to clear the cache and so on for it to go away.,4,04/28/2019,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I've rated this low as recent updates have broken basic funtionality. play and pause really slow _  playlist cannot be ordered and adding doesnt always go to end. worst of all selecting song in directories sometimes plays wrong song. There are many more problems and no way to report them unless you are a software developer.,2,05/07/2019,5
App884,org.videolan.vlc,It has everything I'd ever need _  you can change the speed if play _  equalizer _  you can move audio if it's playing too late or soon _  same with subs and many more functions ~~~~ Since the last update the playback speed always resets to x1 after I close the app _  it's a bother to manually set it everytime,5,08/25/2019,13
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Very annoying bug has followed me through 2 different phones. The app won't recognize some new media (even if I refresh) unless the app is uninstalled and reinstalled. Otherwise _  it's still better than the stock music app.,2,05/27/2019,2
App884,org.videolan.vlc,It's open source and can play anything. But it doesn't do any of that particularly well. Of the 3 media players on my phone _  it is by far the least reliable and most buggy. It absolutely refuses to use subtitle files correctly or even at all sometimes.,3,09/01/2019,10
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I am glad it can play mkv files as that's the only reason I needed video player app. However after a 20-minute episode _  my phone temperature was the same as when it's charging with supercharger. Definitely not normal.,2,09/20/2019,5
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Hate the fact i can't turn it off. When bluetooth connects it just plays and its not accessable to stop it. So annoying. Every time. This should be a toggle option. I had to uninstall even though i love all the rest of it.,2,09/24/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,hello VLC why why why have you made it so difficult to find the equaliser I used to really enjoy this app I even use it on a PC I hate it now on Android because I get so annoyed because I cannot find the damn equalizer it used to be right there but you guys moved it and hidden it and I don't know why what is the point to it well you please correct The Equalizer problem and have a icon for the equalizer on every page thank you and then I'll give you full five star review,1,06/20/2019,10
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Doesn't play files from the beginning. Confirmation to resume from last position doesn't work either. VERY annoying - constantly have to stop what I'm doing and restart the song. Hopefully this can be fixed in future updates,2,10/17/2019,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,This app is the best. For those who want the cast TV feature _  you will completely fall in love with this app. Watching Movies from your mobile phone to your TV is easy and simple _  you can choose to watch both to your phone and TV/PC or only on TV/PC. I love it. 🙏🙏🙏🙏,5,10/13/2019,23
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Thanks for the update _  but still crashes after sleep mode and can not delete a file(cached data until the app is reinstalled or refreshed numerous times. Could you add some radio and upnp + dlna ...google cast is just not stable for us techy - would rather support VLC than other fancy wannabes. Can't send music to network renderers - cheers 🇬🇧.,5,08/14/2019,12
App884,org.videolan.vlc,How do you stop the titles from scrolling? Who's the vagenius that came up with that idea? Terrible when looking for file names.,4,12/08/2019,3

App884,org.videolan.vlc,It was the best for me  _  today it has a lot of bugs _  sometime the sound disappeared and you should restart the app to get it back _  sometime it start from beginning if you switched to other application and returned back. I will change this review when you fix those issue  _  especially: the sound,1,10/30/2019,18
App884,org.videolan.vlc,This no doubt the best application for mp3 _ mp4 _ mp5 _ 3gp _ 3peg you name it. Am very satisfied with this app it's got a lot in it talk of boosting volume up 200 some apps give 💯 only but VCL doubles that so come on download and install it on every device it's also user friendly mention pause and play when headsets are un inserted and inserted respectively,5,11/16/2019,13

App884,org.videolan.vlc,i like that it's open source & does a good job. however _  playlists are not saving properly for me. sometimes it wipes an entire playlist that you've carefully put together - very frustrating. i would also appreciate if 200% Volume Boost could also be used for audio files _  not just video files.,4,12/04/2019,12

App884,org.videolan.vlc,this media player is pretty cool. its plays the videos in good quality _  it allows me to change the theme to what i like _  it only needs better controls in my opinion _  like fast forward and rewind _  pause etc... but outside of that i love it!!,3,05/28/2019,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I love how it reads all type of videos but it disappoint me that the "refresh" button is not working. It cant read new videos I added _  either when I deleted it.

App884,org.videolan.vlc,Latest version update has deleted one of my playlists _  removed all the tracks from another and made the playlist interface wasteful and cumbersome.

App884,org.videolan.vlc,Random mode tends to repeat the same songs _  sometimes in the same sequence. Even if a playlist has more than a thousand songs _  it feels like you are always listening to the same 15-20 songs. Also there is a bug when adding songs to a playlist,2,11/05/2019,9

App884,org.videolan.vlc,This app scans medis automatically even when we set the prerences to do it manually. I wanted to choose the folders because the app plays my voice messages e.g. WhatsApp as audio track. I tried to delete my WhatsApp folder from the VLC and VLC simply deleted all my WhatsApp media from my internal memory! I cannot choose manually which media I want the app to play! Horrible experience!,1,09/27/2019,5

App884,org.videolan.vlc,The app does not recognize m4a files anymore. Deletes songs from playlists or deletes playlists altogether. I do not recommend this app unless you enjoy creating and recreating playlists. EDIT: The old version listed songs by artist when I went into GENRE. Now it only lists them in alphabetical order by song title. What person thought this needed changed. This app is unusable now. Does not play m4a files!,1,07/30/2019,1200

App884,org.videolan.vlc,Syncing the subtitle to 1000ms is easy but 10000ms takes a lot more time.

App884,org.videolan.vlc,Great app and works really well it all formats however one major flaw I see is that it doesn't have a stop button. I have to press the back button each time to exit a video which seems kind of silly? Maybe you could look at implementing that?,4,01/10/2019,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,definitely a best video player. But if we able to drag and change the position of subtitles could be better while so many people like me prefer fit screen option . when we go for fitscreen _  half of the subtitle is getting hidden. pls fix this soon.,5,05/07/2019,35
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Please fix the "Automatic sensor" in which if you turn your phone upside down it will also rotate 180 degrees. Please limit it to 90 degrees only. Also there is a bug in which the deleted movies still shows up in the menu.,3,11/17/2018,0

App884,org.videolan.vlc,Positive first: It's nice that you can exclude some folders from library. Negative: Music keeps speeding up and slowing down ever so slightly which gives pitch slides too. The same mp3s play correctly in other players.,2,09/24/2018,10
App884,org.videolan.vlc,there's no way to change artist and album info so all of the songs are lumped together under one artist.

App884,org.videolan.vlc,You can't choose the way your files are listed _  beyond alpha/rev alpha. That's really annoying. There's other UI nitpicks I have as well _  not sure why this is an editors choice. The PC version is really good...step it up dudes...smart phones are way more relevant now.,3,10/11/2018,12
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Mostly good _  but FF _  RW _  and Jump functions don't work when streaming .ts video.  Oddly _  those functions work fine if the .ts file is copied to the device via wi-fi or usb..  Can this be addressed in a future update?,4,11/26/2018,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,It was an amazing user experience for me but you could make it better by adding lyrics for musics and also add subtitle website when downloading as I can't find them.

App884,org.videolan.vlc,Love the app _  best I've tried _  runs very smoothly. The only problem I have is that whenever i go to swipe up the touchscreen buttons on my samsung s8 I delete things off my playlist _  utterly confusing when im listening to audiobooks.,2,12/03/2018,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I've downloaded almost every media player and had nothing but disappointment until I downloaded this one. I can say after 1 month of using it I've had not one issue of any kind. Great player.,5,05/10/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,App is very good but the latest version is working well in my device moto z play 8.0 The issue is when I want to rotate my device to landscape mode while playing video it converted into PIP mode. I'm not able to see video in full screen mode. Please resolve the issue,4,09/29/2018,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,last version is fine but this latest version removed one feature that is forwarding and backwarding video can be done by just sliding on the screen now we can't do in this latest version that is very dispointing _ very inconvenient forwarding video on the bar is very inconvenient,5,01/18/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Doesn't support SMB 2/3 _  which means it can't access my file share. SMB 1 is riddled with security flaws _  so I'm not turning it back on. Not much use for this app until it supports secure protocols.,1,04/17/2019,4
App884,org.videolan.vlc,The application automatically plays the video that is next in the queue while the current video is still playing and therefore _  the current video never gets to the end. I hope they fix this.,1,04/19/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Second to none for videos _  but if you add an album with various artists it will not keep them together in the album tab. Also seems to have problems reading some video formats on an SD card.,4,10/14/2018,4

App884,org.videolan.vlc,Not always the most polished _  but will play about anything you can throw at it when no other app can. Has been an essential part of the video toolkit for over a decade. First used it on the Mac.,5,12/04/2019,2
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Vlc video player is good..plz remove audio player from it..it suck..for example if you so many songs in your phone _ vlc media liberay  _ take rescan a lot of time..so i have to wait vlc to finish rescan to watch a videos..so plz remove audio player from it and make two sperate apps ..that all..thank you,4,11/23/2018,0

App884,org.videolan.vlc,What happened? This app was brilliant. Nice simple and easy to use. Now it's clunky _  loses my place and won't parse new media without being reinstalled. Trying to use this for work purposes and you have spoiled that for 22 children with useless updates that have ruined the app.,1,05/07/2019,189
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Would give this app 5 out of 5 if not for one issue. Every video that is uploaded into it _  there is 2 of it. Double every single video. If I delete one _  they both disappear. Besides that _  love this app very much.,2,12/08/2018,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Only issue I have with this is App is the disappearing playlists.Its not a big issue  _ but it's annoying that I have to keep recreating my playlists.It is unmatched when it comes to playing music and videos.Playlist need work though.,4,10/01/2018,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,App is pretty amazing. But I hate the fact that if I want to turn the brightness up in between a video _  the app increases the entire device brightness instead of the app only which means after leaving the app _  I need to again go yo Display settings and adjust the device brightness.,3,12/15/2018,2
App884,org.videolan.vlc,overall the it's great but one thing that's very annoying and ruining the usability of the app that if pip is on from the app settings the video will go to pip mode when turned into landscape mode and it won't go full screen on landscape mode it will just go in pip mode. please fix this issue.,4,11/20/2018,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Tried again newly updated version but still media library doesn't load properly. Sort by file name not working and worst part is it is showing weird files like idx.m3u8. I love this player but file arrangement is very very bad. switching back to MX player.,1,06/08/2019,0

App884,org.videolan.vlc,'How to use' overlay appears every time you open.the app. On a tv is annoying because you have to pause and play again (probably on a touch device goes away by touching am empty area) still its damn annoying every time.,1,06/01/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,It doesn't play "every" media file type. I can't play DRM protected music files (unless I am doing it wrong) that I put on my Android phone from iTunes. The computer version is still better.,2,06/10/2019,0

App884,org.videolan.vlc,After casting a few movies and having it lock up and having to restart the movie over and over again .... it was time to move on. I downloaded MX Player and it is much more stable and has many other excellent features that vlc just doesnt have.,1,07/31/2019,6
App884,org.videolan.vlc,The only problem vlc has - auto finding new media file just been downloaded on the storage. sometimes it doesn't catch the new file/files on the gallery even if refreshed manually. that is the reason i'm giving it 4*. on the other sides it's the best media player on android market.,4,08/20/2019,9
App884,org.videolan.vlc,All the crashes on Android 10 have been resolved. Looks like app is stable again. The Android TV app is still glitchy when i scroll around in the menus but it is usable (the beta constantly asked for login info when using SMB shares) but the regular version just has the GUI glitches,4,09/09/2019,87
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Really bad management of local audio files. If pause and go back manually using the player bar _  it's stuck and can't play the file. Going to the next track doesn't work either of manually press next button. Completely useless with audio _  avoid.,1,11/23/2019,1

App884,org.videolan.vlc,Mind blowing app _  without any irritating ads. Just videos grouping on folder wise should also be there (as in MX player). Rest all is prefect. Audio only playback _  no ads _  rewind fast forward etc are mind blowing. Thanks VLC.,5,11/11/2018,2
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Tried to watch some episodes of my favourite TV show and I only got audio. Tried finding a solution online and got absolutely nowhere.

App884,org.videolan.vlc,I'm not sure what happened but since the last update I think the app thinks its on a tablet and not a phone. The menus and lists of videos run off the screen. I can't even see the buttons to press. It is now simply impossible to use.,2,05/10/2019,4

App884,org.videolan.vlc,Very nice app that can play all kinds of video format,5,05/20/2020,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,it sucks after update _  the UI is so terrible _  why the f did you put the play button in front of the 3 dots next to the song list?? also i already refresh but it didn't update the new song i have added _  instead i must search it all over to my directory _  fix the GUI,2,04/27/2019,9
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Could be better. Often doesn't have cast option when open app and have to restart phone. Pausing sometimes makes file start from the beginning again. File can crash if you try to skip forward.,3,12/26/2018,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,P in P closes when you turn off screen. Clicking notification pull down opens app _  then you have to click a small tumb nail that then opens the video. Videos dont arrange in different folders. Video playback out of sync _  sound not matching persons mouth.,1,06/19/2019,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Let me tell you something really stupid about this app. When an audio file is clicked on to play no audio transport controls appear. Really dumb. Other than that I like the app.,4,11/19/2018,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I like the app. But there is problem I face. Though I delete a video from the phone _  the clip still shows in the VLC Directory. That's very annoying.,3,09/15/2018,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,The UI used in your PC version is simple and great. But UI used in Android is confusing and complex somewhat. Why can't you developers get inspired from MX Player's UI ? MX is simple and great just like your PC version.,3,05/12/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Best music app on my huawei. EQ is available also on Bluetooth headphones _  really needed this feature. JUST REMEMBERE TO DISABLE BATTERY OPTIMISATION ON PHONE MANAGER _  so the app doesn't randomly stop when played in the BACKGROUND.,5,04/22/2019,11
App884,org.videolan.vlc,with the latest update _  the same track can appear multiple times in the playlist. please correct this bug. this never happened before in earlier versions,3,04/12/2019,3
App884,org.videolan.vlc,If I pause _  it stops my audio after a while. The beta was better. I was using this for audio books. Now it's completely useless.,1,11/30/2018,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,When connecting to a Chromecast _  subtitles are lost. I've tried a few models _  and the same result occurs _  subtitles inside the container file are ignored. Used to work on the last revision iirc.,3,09/15/2018,5
App884,org.videolan.vlc,VLC has been my go-to media player on PC for years _  and is finally _  just recently _  became stable enough to be my default on Android. This latest version is excellent.,5,04/07/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Why isnt there a feature to hide certain directories so they dont appear in VLCs list of media? I have unwanted voice memos and ringtones appearing in my list of audio files and theres no way to hide them without deleting the actual files.,2,05/24/2019,5
App884,org.videolan.vlc,It's fine _  but It's terrible with older file formats.. Don't bother if you want a video player for thing's you downloaded _  this is far more streaming and online focused strangely.,3,04/27/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Great app. It has a good interface and the main selling point is the big range of files/codecs it supports. Better than the other one I have called MX Player,5,12/11/2018,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Great App for viewing all videos and movies both online and offline. #1 best software both on the computer _  and smartphones. I use for all my viewing needs.,5,10/13/2018,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,While any video played in HEVC format the video stops and audio plays continously.... after some times it plays normally and again this problem is been faced. Im using kitkat android os will that be the reason for this bug???,3,03/22/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Swiping on songs(album view) in full screen always scrolls the page away. Fix it please its the worst thing about this app...4/2/19 Edit. Still does it just not as bad 5/31/19 maybe add in a option to lock the scroll down on album view so it no constantly showing the songs list.,2,06/03/2019,52
App884,org.videolan.vlc,it's a far cry from the PC version. no loop play or playlist. can't remove file title at start. makes this app useless for me. I had my hopes up but no. just a basic video player.,2,05/15/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,After all these fixes it still doesn't recognize when i add new videos to my phone. I have to go into settings and uncheck media libraries folder and check it again for it to load my videos. Even that is not 100% guaranteed to work!,1,07/09/2019,12
App884,org.videolan.vlc,VLC is the only video/audio player i ever use anymore. Versatile _  easy _  organized _  just all around a great program. I recommend this to everyone.,5,04/06/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I really love it because of everything and every connection I do with it. even with a local network on my computer is able to do a very good job with shared files,5,04/12/2019,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,In mx player when the video is runnig we can see the video time _ remaning time _ battery life etc in the up corner or down if thos could be added in vlc too and also all the video of a folder can be played just by taping next button then the vlc player will be parfect...,4,09/19/2018,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Overall it is a good app. Recently I'm noticing a problem where vlc is unable to stream content at more than 50 fps. Frames get clunky and sometimes the video altogether stops _  although the audio still keeps on working. Otherwise an excellent app.,3,01/04/2019,3
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Stopped updating this after it demanded microphone access. No idea why it would need this since it does not record anything. Have VLC gone in to the espionage business? I do not know. Old version is still great.,1,03/25/2019,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,One of the best video players for Android I ever used. UI sometimes is not very intuitive _  but wide variety of supported formats and amazing quality of video playback and lots of features compensate the drawbacks.,5,06/06/2019,28
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I like this app.. but disappointment with lack of effects.. for example while device in auto rotation mode _  the player effect is not that much smooth while changing video orientation.. Also features like remembering last played media in each fooder is missing,4,06/12/2019,5
App884,org.videolan.vlc,The one item really missing is if you temporary fixed the audio delay _  then why not complete the task by implementing the adjustment. Also the is no definition except by chance the audio delay is saved for the session. Booooo.,2,09/13/2019,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,current version does not use full screen for audio playback in horizontal orientation. very annoying. it would also be improved if audio could use swipe gesture for seeking as video does. also _  resume audio does not always work,2,07/24/2019,5
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Best audio player on Android. Not very good at resume. Playback speed will be reset after vlc restart. Cannot recover last exit point. Musicolet works better regarding to this. Merit: Extensive format support. Change playback speed. High stability.,4,06/28/2019,147
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Since recent New updates VLC is better than ever! Before updates _  When I clicked on audio or video I used to have a list of former files which wasn't on my phone anymore but now it isn't the case anymore. Glad to have had useful updates!,5,10/15/2019,11
App884,org.videolan.vlc,it can load any of my videos unless I look for it in d directory after I check my file mange.And update didn't fix anything I've used it on my other phone and it is d best video player I've have but I can't recommend it until u fix it and I'm only giving u 5 stars bcus I want you to fix it quickly I WANT MY BEST VIDEO PLAYER BACK,5,07/13/2019,4
App884,org.videolan.vlc,its good application for video and audio player _  also if you provided in audio player mode to select folder option it will be greatful _ . because we kept song in different folder and in audio player mode as genere _  album like folder option provided it will be easy to player our song easiley,4,07/09/2019,7
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Thanks for updating the video title thing it was really annoying not to be able to see the actual video title as it was showing only metadata. It was the only thing that was holding me back to use vlc on Android. I love this app now. MX player sucks!,5,07/28/2019,4
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Doesn't handle accepting external links from other apps well _  android 10,3,03/08/2020,9
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I spent a good half hour trying to disable autoplay when my phone connects with the car via blutooth. Such a simple function should be obvious and if I am missing something please let me know. in the meantime _  I will uninstall.,3,08/13/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I always loved VLC but it is so not user friendly. If I just slightly touch my screen it rewinds or zooms. And if that happens I can't watch the rest of the video _  the sound plays in the background but the video itself freezes...,1,09/27/2019,10
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Most of the time VLC is unable to detect the media files on my android phone. I keep cleaning cache _  every thing to show the media files. But failed to do so. Even right now _  vlc is not showing the movie I have in my android.,3,11/26/2019,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,vlc has been the ultimate player! Doesn't matter what file-types  _  VLC covers more range than most people have or even use. It's such a sturdy player and can easily access and change the variables to your liking. It's the ultimate player hands down!!,5,10/05/2019,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Vlc is best for video playing. This app support all type of video without any voice interruption and video quality is good,5,12/07/2019,7
App884,org.videolan.vlc,The update is horrible! I can't control the size of the player. Meaning _  it leaves no ability to use Androids on screen buttons.,1,12/08/2019,2
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Used to love this App _  has begun to go downhill fairly quick. One moment I am able to cast to my tv the next it says my media can't be found. After reinstalling 5 different times I'm done.,2,10/29/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Doesn't show specific folders with mp3 _  can't parse media in it _  even after renaming the folders.,2,02/03/2020,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,VLC is the best video player by far! Thank you 5* EDIT: bug in new version _  %% signs show everywhere when selecting "Group videos by Folder" in directory names.

App884,org.videolan.vlc,vlc was my favorite player all the time.But nowadays it doesn't download subtitles.it always shows "Subtitles not found". i am unable to get even a single subtitle for the past 2 months. i thought its a bug and tried to update the app but still i am facing the issue .,2,01/11/2019,52

App884,org.videolan.vlc,Has always worked across platforms for me. Excellent. The video playback for many files _  such as in a series works brilliantly. I just wish I could work out how to sync the subtitle track on movies where the sync is out.....,5,02/01/2019,5
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Works great for watching videos but it's terrible at playing music _  music sounds weird on this player like it slowly starts to switch the tone back and forth and after many updates it still the same,4,05/02/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,No gapless playback? Seriously? This is something I've had since winamp on xp and in 2019 the developers behind vlc still can't figure out how to implement gapless playback? Pathetic.,1,04/02/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Need update. Videos are not auto scaning _  deleted videos are still shown in VLC app and not able to delete from vlc. Some video are not able to play in vlc. Always crashing while opening. Need definite update for Android.,2,10/31/2018,11
App884,org.videolan.vlc,its a great media player + but you need to make it easier for vlc to be able to read my phones sd card and a better sd card refresh rate and ability if you fix that its perfect ill give 5 stars im a die-hard vlc advocate please make vlc mobile vers. as fast and easy as the pc version,3,03/20/2019,0

App884,org.videolan.vlc,Resisting update until confirmed that casting to Chromecast is provided. Some updates ago we were advised it was being removed and to be then returned. I've not since read anything to suggest it has been returned.,2,01/31/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,It's very sweet VLC is my best video watching app apart from the audio that doesn't move to the next after the initial played _  but it's still cool thought I haven't tried HD but so far it's my best video app thumbs up guys,5,11/26/2018,5
App884,org.videolan.vlc,When deleting files the app sometimes doesn't update the list and I need to literally delete it's cache to fix it. It's awful. Definitely worse than MX Player _  but at least it had no ads.,2,10/10/2018,7

App884,org.videolan.vlc,I have problems with the app _  but it is amazing how people can trash talk the most free app on the play store. Every other app is paid for or has ads. VLC is 100% free!!! I dont know whaf benefits they get from giving us free app.,4,05/17/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,It's pretty buggy when casting I have to say. Sometimes it errors _  some times the casting lags _  it's VERY hit and miss. Shame there isn't an alternative.,3,11/19/2018,4
App884,org.videolan.vlc,videos recorded in portrait on phones cant be rotated in Android TV version. Why leave out such an important function? Most home videos are recorded on phones and many people dont think to film in landscape.,2,05/25/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,The general app is great plays almost everything except for .TS files: when playing TS files the video breaks for both android and windows vlc. I think this should be resolved in the next update,4,11/03/2018,0

App884,org.videolan.vlc,App always stops working and force closes. Randomly "parses" media which takes forever. Will randomly double songs for an entire album so that you can't listen to an album straight thru without listening to each song twice.,1,03/01/2019,8

App884,org.videolan.vlc,VLC crashes after exiting app for extended period of time (over 5 minutes or so). Have to navigate back to the video & scroll back to where I stopped watching _  very inconvenient...,3,05/30/2019,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,When it works _  it works fine. Unfortunately _  prety soon every installation stops updating the video library and the video files can only be opened from the Explore My Files folder. Also _  is there a way to enque/playlist files and I missed it?,3,06/01/2019,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Finally _  a music app that will play wma files. Its also ad free. My only complaint is that there is no way to change the album art. For my music at least a lot of the album art is wrong or missing,4,08/27/2019,4

App884,org.videolan.vlc,Was working great but now it no longer detects my pc _  I can still force it to play the video through esfile explorer but it constantly interrupts in an attempt to search for the lan. Works on all my other media players. But vlc is my favorite :(,1,09/15/2019,3
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Fantastic! The versatility of this app is beyond words. MUST read up about all of its amazing fearures before judging it as an ordinary media player. My favourite is VLCs ability to stream ANY movie type from a upnp,5,06/16/2019,2
App884,org.videolan.vlc,With the video > "video playlist mode" option. It does not do anything when selecting a video in the directory view. I would like it if it could create a playlist from that video and all videos in the directory.,4,10/09/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Consistently plays whatever video or audio I throw at it _  without issues. It even beats out several of the top paid video players I've tried on Android _  and remains my top pick for media playback _  for both Android and PC.,5,07/09/2019,26
App884,org.videolan.vlc,need to restart the video if it is minimised in between the video. there is no feature to see if the video is already watched. all the folders need to be traversed to see the videos. instead only videos need to be displayed,1,07/18/2019,1

App884,org.videolan.vlc,Really wish you would include a folder option as not all tracks are properly tagged and with a few 100gb of music it sucks to have half a cd in the unknown/various artists folders. I'd be willing to rate 5 stars once a folder option is included.,4,11/04/2019,4
App884,org.videolan.vlc,The more you improve VLC _  the less useful an application it becomes. 10 years ago it's quality and versatility couldn't be matched. Now... It's just another app cluttering up the desktops of the world. Keep up the good work.,5,11/26/2019,6
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Great app overall especially the multi format playback. The only reason for 4 stars is for me it drops the place where the audio was manually paused and starts from the beginning of the file. For lengthy files _  it is quite annoying.,4,10/08/2019,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Great video player _  works great on Chromecast. New design is pretty good too.,5,12/06/2019,8

App884,org.videolan.vlc,VLC is the best. No ads etc. Problem faced is the subtitle path isn't remembered once you minimise the app and go back to it. You can't use the 'select the Subtitle' option. I'll have to close the app _  restart then select the sub. Never used to happen before.,3,08/13/2019,3
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Needs a LOT of work integrating with Chromecast. Eg _  only displays the first 3 devices. I have 5 _  & will be adding more. Also _  the timeout on the phone screen is pitifully short when casting.,4,10/27/2019,1

But this never happened with YouTube _  and now I'm quite afraid if this will happen with other android apps which I'm using on both my devices..,1,10/06/2019,0

App884,org.videolan.vlc,Crashes far too often to be useful. Casting is flaky - while the Google Home (and pretty much every app that supports) can see there is a device to cast _  VLC doesn't often. Shame _  because this is otherwise an essential app.,1,08/24/2019,6
App884,org.videolan.vlc,The best. Especially if you need this to watching in FHD. No problems so far. No Ads is a massive critical point for me to choose this Video Player!,5,11/13/2018,1

App884,org.videolan.vlc,Decent but has issues with losing its place if focus is lost. Other random bugs come and go as versions go by. Plays RTSP stream once but not a second time when saved for example,3,01/17/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Used to like it until this new update that changed the GUI so much. Lost a lot of functionality because of it _  like fast forwarding _  or seeing the list of songs in a playlist.,2,04/08/2019,3

App884,org.videolan.vlc,The best Video Player. Period Hated MX Player for their ads and video streaming service _  was looking for an alternative and found VLC Player. No ads _ no extras. Just a pure Video Player experience. Thank you.,5,02/19/2019,6

App884,org.videolan.vlc,This is an awesome app _  however _  I have a concern. When I speed up the playback speed of a video to about 1.60 (my way of self - amusement) the app makes the video sound go all stuttery and distorted.,5,05/07/2019,14
App884,org.videolan.vlc,After pie update home screen widget will lose the cover art. I have to skip to the next song and then back or open the app and reselect desired track. VLC also loses track of all media and displays no media files found.,1,04/27/2019,5

App884,org.videolan.vlc,I am unable to download subtitles automatically _  the next update should please focus on improving subtitles and it's download _  for example MX Player has really good subtitles repository. Overall it's a good app _  I'll recommend it.,3,05/29/2019,110
App884,org.videolan.vlc,It's great to play music _  still sounds ok at over 100% volume _  but it sounds terrible playing the videos. Btw _  I'm using samsung j2 prime _  if that's needed.,2,06/01/2019,0

App884,org.videolan.vlc,Super Great app. So simple yet does everything for you. There is one thing annoying tho _  the controls on subtitle and audio delay. Pls add a manual number input _  not just add and subtract. But overall _  Amazing app.,4,08/22/2019,8
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Love the app. It's better than the one for windows. I have a recommendation though _  the only thing the app lacks is the option to change the artwork of soundtracks.,5,09/05/2019,10
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Has a bug with subtitles - only has the option to add them manually _  and while filling out the title and season _  it closes before you can enter the episode number. Other than that _  excellent app,4,10/05/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,In this November update _  the eq isn't powerful. I don't like it. I used to use this app precisely because of the great and powerful equalizer. Now the Bass that come out from VLC is simply bad and not deep.,3,12/05/2019,5
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Can't even Chromecast properly. Always stops casting when the phone is turned off. Sometimes the Chromecast button doesn't even show up. Sometimes the video on the TV disconnects and I can't get it to connect again. Too buggy to be used properly.,1,11/01/2019,92
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Unbelievably great app! Thank you for work,5,12/27/2019,0

App884,org.videolan.vlc,My experience is that while listening to music _  audio is always intermittent _  almost as if the player is unable to read file. I use VLC on my pc _  but only on Android is the audio intermittent,3,11/08/2019,0
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I don't know why _  but VLC keeps scanning my internal memory for the media library everytime I start it even though I've checked the "auto rescan on startup" setting. And in the process it renders my phone useless _  eating up literally the entire CPU.,1,11/18/2019,9
App884,org.videolan.vlc,One of the best video player on Android _  worths 5 stars but one is taken because the ticket 8398 for boosting audio volume is still pending. VLC plays video 50% less loud than other player apps. We need to boost!,4,11/19/2019,2
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I do like VLC but as an audio player it has an annoying bug that causes it to speed up and slow down during music playback. Not by much and maybe some people will never notice it _  but it's quite conspicuous to me.,3,11/28/2019,145
App884,org.videolan.vlc,The best _  used for years on my PC.,5,03/15/2020,1

App884,org.videolan.vlc,Been using vlc on pc and android for long years _  and still love it. I think it would be a lot of help if there's a frame to frame click button.. Nice work,5,10/15/2018,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,I love the app.. Sometimes when you need to concentrate on your video _  _  _ you can just lock it to avoid mistakes (clicking a button intentionally),5,10/27/2018,4

App884,org.videolan.vlc,Can't stop and restart audio. There's actually only a pause button. The app fights you when you try to restart a single song. Very disappointed for such a mature application.,2,08/03/2019,6
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Although I like it overall _  it's horrible at showing which video is highlighted to be played next on many of my android devices. There needs to be a clearer indicator of which video is highlighted to be played next.,3,08/13/2019,2
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Doesn't properly close. Pause audio _  close app _  click play on headphones and it starts vlc audio again instead of the running audio player. So clearly VLC is running in the background and not really closing...force quit doesn't even stop it.,1,08/23/2019,6
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Perfect. I like the mode of background playing. Sometimes just want to hear the sound from the video clip instead of watching it. Other apps seldom offer this setting. Thanks.,5,09/17/2019,3
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Works well _  but the playback buttons gets under the navigation buttons of the OS (which hides automatically and comes back when you interact with the screen)  _  kinda annoying.,3,11/11/2019,1
App884,org.videolan.vlc,Can't even go to the folder and tell it to play THIS one. Forgets all music _  I have to reboot phone to make it find it again. Didn't used to have to do that. I'm uninstalling until I find out it's fixed.,2,12/01/2019,0

App884,org.videolan.vlc,I've always used and love VLC _  but what happened to the pop-up window option? Settings have picture-in-picture mode turned on _  but doesn't work. 5 stars if you fix this.,3,11/16/2019,0

App884,org.videolan.vlc,What was once a reliable app is now garbage. The titles are now scrolling _  making the titles illegible. No option to change it back. Great example of ego driven "improvements" that just succeed in breaking otherwise useable software.,1,12/06/2019,12
App884,org.videolan.vlc,The interface is so hard to work with. It's a dice roll to see if I can successfully queue another song or start playing it and delete the play queue I've set up. The most recent update also wiped all of my playlists,1,12/05/2019,19
