App638,com.ubergeek42.WeechatAndroid,Broken. Opening and reopening the app shows me theres a hamburger menu in the top right. Probably can set my host in there. But unfortunately _  it disappears immediately. Update: fixed by unpinning my nav bar. Update2: managed to get connected. Selected "weechat ssl" when what I should've selected was "websocket ssl" (I'm connecting to a reverse proxy over ssl/https). Casued a horrible crash loop. Reinstall fixed it. App is actually pretty good despite first impressions _  nice UI.,4,08/29/2019,7

App638,com.ubergeek42.WeechatAndroid,Easiest way to connect relay to my weechat IRC client on my linux/bsd server. Working great so far on Android Pie. It still lacks of 'input insert' commands. So _  I cannot use 'input colors' there too! Apart from that _  it's working great - better than any paid/free Android standalone IRC client!,5,01/23/2019,4

App638,com.ubergeek42.WeechatAndroid,fantastic app when it does work _  but clearly doesn't like nougat - has not been successfully connecting since then. dev _  hit me up for details - no bug report option in the app as far as I can tell. forced to use glowing bear at the moment and this app is definitely superior to it.,2,10/06/2016,20
App638,com.ubergeek42.WeechatAndroid,Had some crashing issues at first but now it works like a charm. The only thing missing is loading earlier messages _  like in Glowing Bear. Also _  it loses the scroll position when focus is lost.,5,02/04/2016,19
App638,com.ubergeek42.WeechatAndroid,Installed Weechat into an ArchLinuxARM chroot _  rsync'd my config files from my desktop _  ran it in a term and connected to localhost in the app.  10\10 My only gripe is that it doesn't like my physical tab key.,5,03/21/2016,16

App638,com.ubergeek42.WeechatAndroid,Very nice to use on both tablets and phones. Nice amount of customization and the SSH tunnel feature is a cool extra. And it's completely free and open source _  with no in-app purchases or ads _  which is hard to come by these days.,5,01/18/2016,1
App638,com.ubergeek42.WeechatAndroid,I've gone through all _  and I mean all of them _  and this definitely the best. I know this is basically not a real IRC client _  but it is still the best.,5,10/16/2017,11

App638,com.ubergeek42.WeechatAndroid,Long time weechat user _  and I just discovered its relay capabilities. Previously I had used yaiic with ZNC on my server _  in addition to weechat on my server _  but this removes the need for ZNC entirely. Such a great app. edit: year and a half later _  still in development and very much improved. The interface is absolutely wonderful _  and beats any standalone client on the Play Store.,5,11/05/2014,5
App638,com.ubergeek42.WeechatAndroid,This app is absolutely fantastic! I was worried it might chew up a lot of battery being in the background all of the time _  but that is absolutely not the case. Very _  very light on battery usage.  There are a few small quirks like a limited buffer size (I think it might only be 500 lines and is a fixed number).,5,10/13/2015,0
App638,com.ubergeek42.WeechatAndroid,But it is true! It really works! Not sure if joining a channel is not yet supported or if I've been looking in the wrong places _  but that's no big deal.,5,11/15/2014,0
App638,com.ubergeek42.WeechatAndroid,Love the app _ and its efficiency. Only issue I have is the limited scroll back. The web app has links to load further history  _ which I used rather frequently. Addition of that feature would render this app rather perfect.,5,03/22/2015,0
App638,com.ubergeek42.WeechatAndroid,The Menu button doesn't work on Android 5.1 so the app cannot be used in it's present state. When you click the button _  nothing happens. The menu doesn't open or anything at all. This is on my Nexus 7 (2012) running stock Android  5.1.,1,04/02/2015,3

App638,com.ubergeek42.WeechatAndroid,It was already great _  now it is even better! If we only could show/hide timestamps without leaving conversation window _  it would make this program a perfect,5,10/26/2014,0

App638,com.ubergeek42.WeechatAndroid,This is exactly to my taste _  a lot of good design choices here and it's very comfortable to use. It's also free as in freedom which is a huge bonus. I disagree with other commenters stating it's not much better than using an ssh client _  I think the Android client is a much nicer experience myself.  But good things aside _  as it's still in beta with a few prominent bugs it would be silly to give it 5 stars. (Then what would I give it when/if it reaches a more robust state?)  Two of the bugs I've noticed so far is that is seems to randomly crash a lot and that colors in prefixes do not match my weechat.conf while the text does.  I really hope this great app will get further development.,4,05/25/2013,14
App638,com.ubergeek42.WeechatAndroid,I just recently starting using Weechat in general _  but this Android app is pure icing on the cake. It's got all of the essentially features down pat _  and in a very smooth way. Sure _  there are extras I wouldn't mind having that would be cool to have in the future _  but it's already got everything I actually need.,5,11/30/2013,7
App638,com.ubergeek42.WeechatAndroid,This application is fantastic. It makes using IRC on your phone a great experience. I  would highly recommend using it. It does have issues with crashing _  but the great interface more than makes up for that.,4,11/17/2013,1
App638,com.ubergeek42.WeechatAndroid,There are probably things to improve but for me this is already perfect. Let's see how much it will drain battery :-),5,08/04/2013,3

App638,com.ubergeek42.WeechatAndroid,I opened the app and did not see any preferences option in the menu. Just settings.
