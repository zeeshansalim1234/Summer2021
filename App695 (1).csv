App695,acr.browser.lightning,Not sure about this _  but first of all _  when updating adblock is it normal to be redirected to malwarebites page to download some browser extention? I was infected with some payload and I think it was from downloading adblock list but I'm not 100% sure... I would like to know if dowloading adblock list could be security issue ???? How safe is this browser? Give 1* for now but not sure Also exporting bookmarks _  deleting data and importing boolmarks inverse URL and description in the bookmark!,1,04/20/2020,1
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Its a good browser _  light _  fast _  have an editeble ad-block host _  a black theme _  still using a lot of ram though _  without any bloatware and fuss using it. But the bookmark have a problem. When you've try to click the bookmark that has been exported from other phone _  error pop up mentioning that 'This file doesn't exist anymore'. All my bookmark have gone _  useless _  dysfunction and err. Please fix this _  because almost 200 of my bookmark have gone just like that... Thank you,3,04/21/2020,1
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Just what I was looking for: A fast browser with Ad Block AND great Reader Mode. No more garbage _  just pure info. Wish I could "Share To" it. Otherwise _  perfect!,5,03/24/2020,7
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Love this thing. I purchased the Pro version a long ways back _  and it has been fun to watch Lightning grow and mature. I highly recommend this browser.,5,12/20/2019,1
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Been using this app for a very looong time. Tried many and stopped at this one. Hands down the best browser. Buy the pro version.,5,03/25/2020,0
App695,acr.browser.lightning,There is a text entry bug in the address/search bar. If your text extends past the width of the field it will crash the keyboard and clear the text you entered. Considering it hasn't been updated for over a year _  and things aren't really moving on github _  I can only recommend this browser if you have really short search queries.,2,10/17/2018,10
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Lightning + is my new default browser for my Android TV box. (The free version does not have ad-blocking.) Unlike Chrome and most Android browsers _  Lightning page navigation is mouse-friendly. Lightning's extra mouse-drag.content navigation is easier and faster than Chrome's remote control arrow-down and page-down mouse navigation. I tested dozens of Android browsers. Lightning is the one with the best balance of features. Lightning is feature-rich like Chrome without the bloat _  mouse-friendly like Firefox _  and _  best of all _  it has options to offload certain links to external apps like YouTube that are better able to render content. I also like READER MODE with independent font size and dark mode flexibility. Old versions of Lightning were fast but feature-poor. The new Lightning has both speed and great features.,5,05/28/2019,12
App695,acr.browser.lightning,I don't know what to think now. AR has been adding commits on github semi regularly _  even giving Lightning a new icon. So _  it must not be dead. But maybe wants it to be 100% perfect before an update? Or just super busy? I sometimes try another browser but tbh _  nothing is as easy and intuitive to use as this.,4,01/02/2019,9
App695,acr.browser.lightning,only thing missing is a way to open links in new tabs..and I'm pretty sure it did that before..other then that _  lbp is the best android browser I've ever used..worth every penny,5,01/27/2020,1
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Although having quite some very useful unique features _  this browser seems to be abondonware _  at least the version here on Play store. Recently it also started to crash with sites other browsers don't have issues with. I therefore find myself using other browsers more and more... Finding hard to recommend supporting this browser to anyone by buying this plus version.,3,05/30/2019,4
App695,acr.browser.lightning,This browser has been working amazingly. It's fast and intuitively great. I still get some ads even though I've disabled them _  I don't get them with the Dolphin Zero browser but I'll still tinker with settings to see if I can get rid of them.,4,01/09/2019,1
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Long time user _  the latest version keeps locking up and crashing. on a Oneplus 6T with Android 10.,2,12/28/2019,5
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Hi _  thanks for the update _  it's much appreciated. However the new icon is ugly as sin _  can you please change it back? The old icon was so beautiful. Or at least change the garish orange to yellow to fit the old color palette,4,09/06/2019,2
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Great to see the return of my favorite browser. Unfortunately downloading files/images seems to be broken. Hoping it's fixed soon. 5 Stars.,4,09/21/2019,0
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Sometime simplicity is often the hardest thing to accomplish. So by keeping this browser so clean and simple _  you have done a good job.,5,10/19/2019,6
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Great basic browser. No updates for the past 2 years. Looks like the developer abandoned this one.,2,08/20/2019,3
App695,acr.browser.lightning,A very good lightweight browser _  but adblocking isn't 100% perfect (see independant.co.uk website as an example). refund requested.,3,03/03/2019,1
App695,acr.browser.lightning,An incredible browser that fully meets my needs. Finally _  I can set the type size and it holds for most sites I enjoy. Well Done _  Anthony!,5,09/08/2019,4
App695,acr.browser.lightning,I tried alot of alternative browsers but keep reinstalling lightning. Finally bought the paid version.,4,08/09/2019,0

App695,acr.browser.lightning,Paid for Lightning. Was my go to. Now _  seems like deserted app that I no longer know! About to give up on browser _  altogether! But _  where does one go? Shame to developer!,2,05/11/2019,2
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Ad block doesn't work. Hasn't been updated in years.,1,07/24/2019,0
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Been using this browser for more than 2 years now _  it had been abandoned but now it's BACK & READY TO CONQUER 💪,5,10/02/2019,2
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Decided to give Lightning a go again. It will not sign in to twitter. Twitter send me a code via text but Lightning will not bring up a page to enter the code.,2,11/11/2018,4
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Great features _  fantastic UX _  and finally getting updates again! Yay!,5,09/05/2019,0

App695,acr.browser.lightning,Is this app still supported by dev?,5,09/29/2018,2
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Great browser very fast. Can you please add force enable zoom websites like espn and and a few others dont zoom. Very annoying to keep changing the text size. Thanks.,5,11/02/2019,1
App695,acr.browser.lightning,UPDATE: please add SNI support. I really love it. I have a couple of suggestions. Please 1) add a true full screen mode (hiding the bottom android bar) _  and 2) make web page background color customisable like in uc browser - it's vital for reading.,5,04/03/2020,1
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Works great again. Super fast _  blocks ads. Only real downside is no search widget. Could use more customization options too _  but it gets the job done.,4,11/17/2019,4
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Update: the app has been getting updates. 5/5,5,10/11/2019,3
App695,acr.browser.lightning,The finest _  fastest _  most reliable browser for android with an icon that makes it look like a weather app,5,10/01/2019,4
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Nice,5,09/29/2019,0
App695,acr.browser.lightning,EDIT: had to remove a star. It will not make shortcuts on the home screen. My phone and launcher are updated too. ORIGINAL REVIEW: The plus is No ads! and Fast. Seems to get better updating than the non-plus browser. Like this light weight browser better on a phone than I do Firefox. Firefox is my favorite on my PC at work. For a cell phone browser _  most of the time _  less is more. I don't want to be sucked into the Internet while using my cell phone.,4,04/18/2019,0
App695,acr.browser.lightning,I love the look and UI for this app but I got it for the unlimited tabs and at currently over 50 tabs _  the pages take upwards of ten minutes to fully load. Smooth sailing so long as I don't leave the app at all for even a second. Makes it virtually unusable. Idk maybe it's my device processor _  but I've not had this problem in other browsers (but I also don't like them as much D: ) Hoping for a magic update that fixes this.,3,11/09/2017,10
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Love it! WELL worth the money for the full version. I came for the ad-blocking _  and stayed for everything else. It really is as quick as lightning _  super light on system resources _  and easy to navigate. I do miss some of the gestures from Chrome (particularly the "swipe down to view tabs" gesture) _  but that's just an issue of retraining my brain. A+!!,5,07/07/2017,26
App695,acr.browser.lightning,There's an awful bug that doesn't allow you to use the space bar if you want to type a search term from the url box. Ruined the whole experience for me. There's free browsers like Dee Browser that are the same as this one _  but without awful bugs. I can't believe this a paid app,2,08/29/2017,20
App695,acr.browser.lightning,The developers are either idiots or lazy. The ad blocking feature blocks entire websites or important page content and works terribly. If you try to use adguard at alleviate this you'll get hundreds of "untrusted certificate" notifications every time you go to a different web page. Regret buying it.,1,11/03/2017,13
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Worked perfect until a few weeks ago. Then browsing experience slowed down/surfing with lightning didn't work anymore. First thought it's my connection _  but other apps and browsers worked just fine. Would like to continue to use and support the browser _  maybe dev can help. LG G3 _  Android 6.0,2,09/28/2017,4
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Great browser _  my daily driver for a long time now. Lightweight and still feature packed. Bug with the latest version: sometimes pressing back (on the phone _  not within the browser) goes back 2 webpages rather than 1... Extremely annoying _  please fix...,4,12/18/2017,6
App695,acr.browser.lightning,I used to like this one _  but lately out has become unusable. Search results from Google just show up as a page of xml _  among other rendering issues _  and the back button just reloads the page instead of going back to the previous page _  which is just maddening. Cannot recommend in this state.,2,11/18/2017,7
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Good work. Thanks _  I found the back button.  this is still the best browser _  and mobile design. It promotes PRIVACY _  doesn't skimp on features that really matter _  and JUST WORKS. At this point _  I can't ask for a better browser. Has everything I want _  and nothing I don't want. Permissions are great _  and love Duck Duck go integration _  and Tor friendly is important. Thanks again.,5,07/20/2018,2
App695,acr.browser.lightning,A gem: non-invasive permissions; fast yet effectively private when used wisely; useful settings; no bloat. Lightweight _  quick _  & simple compared to reliables like Firefox.  (Will _  tho _  freeze on my device if I don't limit the number|size of pages opened during one session _  but I usualky pay attention to how much I'm loading.) The significant-for-me annoyance is that it fails to perform important tasks automatically when I close the browser on my device: I always must manually empty the cache and delete cookies each time I use the browser.,5,04/05/2018,0
App695,acr.browser.lightning,This browser is nearly perfect. The swipe right or left depending on what option you choose feature is phenomenal... The biggest problem with this app is the battery drain and I don't know why it does this. If that can be fixed it's immediately five stars. I know the developer probably means well but doesn't look at this app as something worth consistently updating. Hope that changes and he fixes the battery drain issue with it because otherwise it's amazing,3,09/08/2018,0
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Really great browser in many aspects! But there are some severe bugs. Mainly with opening links. Sometimes I have to click multiple times or reload the tab. Other times it just doesn't open the link at all. Other than that this browser would be really amazing.,3,11/26/2017,1
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Have a little respect and give an update or stop charging. Has-been app. This is a waste of money. Do not bother. Runs ok on some sites _  not at all on many. Very fast on any site not updated in the last 5 years. Robbery.,1,10/31/2018,0
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Would be 5 stars except for the bugs.... For example in incognito tab you cannot type in an address without the cursor jumping out of the field. Had made it unusable,4,10/02/2017,2
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Browser is fast _  but why it constantly pops up warning saying web site certificates not trusted when browsing even some popular web sites _  like cnn.com _  yahoo.com _  etc. I think you need to update your trusted root certificate repository. Chrome browser does not have this problem _  so it is definitely not web sites problem.,4,09/02/2018,0
App695,acr.browser.lightning,It's ok. Switching between normal and private mode is confusing _  and there's no way to go back to normal mode when a private tab is open. Fast _  smooth _  and its settings are very complete. Edit January 2018. The back button has a bug _  it doesn't go to the immediately previous web page _  but skips some of them and redirect to an old page.,4,01/09/2018,0
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Could be at least a 3 or possibly 4 star app if the bugs were fixed _  but  ---- the dev doesn't reply back. I emailed them several times regarding a  ---- problem _  and I never received the first response. Because of that _  the dev  ---- does not deserve the money I gave them for this app _  and it shows me how  ---- little they care about us. Problems: When you hit the back button _  it force  ---- closes the entire browser every time. Totally defeats the purpose of  ---- "browsing". It also crashes occasionally when it's running in the  ---- background. Which tells me the app is unstable. There's a small memory leak  ---- which is causing battery drain. And finally _  there's no way to import  ---- bookmarks from other browsers. You'll have to resave all your favorites.,1,04/18/2018,2
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Hands down the best browser on the play store! Even on a flagship device _  this ultra lightweight _  yet feature packed browser runs laps around bloated browsers like Chrome _  Firefox _  Opera and Dolphin. 10/10 _  would recommend,5,07/09/2017,4
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Much the easiest browser to use on a phone. The elegance of using swipes left and right sides of the screen for tabs and bookmarks is lovely  Back button problem wasn't their fault _  and was fixed elsewhere,5,02/03/2018,1
App695,acr.browser.lightning,This is the first and only app I have ever reviewed and that's because it is a masterpiece.  Fastest _  most intuitive browser I've tried out of all of them.  My tablet is pretty weak and Lightning Browser improved my web experience exponentially.,5,08/31/2017,0
App695,acr.browser.lightning,First off _  I would like to say thank you so much for continuing the development of the app and putting a lot of hard work into it.  Second _  I have a request. Can you move the address bar _  settings _  etc down to the bottom and introduce it as an option. I would really appreciate it.,5,07/15/2017,4
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Big bug recently with back button: instead of going back to the previous page _  it goes back to the previous site... Lightning is almost unusable as it is 👎,1,01/01/2018,3
App695,acr.browser.lightning,When clear on exit is checked hitting back goes alway back to home page and all history is lost without exiting the app  _  needs to be fixed . Look and feel otherwise  _  but I bought the app for clear on exit and that is not working .,3,01/13/2018,1
App695,acr.browser.lightning,As the Dev. says: Try the Free Version first. If you like it _  then consider installing the Plus version for the additional features. DEVS: Thanks for having a (User Agent) Desktop option. Samsung Galaxy TAB-4 8.0" Tablet (Android 5.1.1) _   Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3 phone _  Android 4.2.2.,5,11/17/2017,1
App695,acr.browser.lightning,I got this browser to use with i2p _  but it doesn't seem to recognise the .i2p domain.  I can open links to i2p sites but can't type them into the address bar.,2,08/10/2017,2
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Excellent. Easy to use _  great with Orbot enabled. Recommended.  ---- Unfortunately it suffers from some crashing when opening links (I'm using  ---- duck gogo).,4,07/31/2018,0
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Good browser _  but it hasn't been updated in years. Freezes and crashes often.,1,07/11/2019,1
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Used now for over 2 years daily and it is fantastic _  no bloated browser here _  fast and reliable and Dev is very active in updating.,5,07/13/2017,11

App695,acr.browser.lightning,Is worse off than other "low bandwidth" type browsers. Just save your dollar and download a free one instead.,1,07/19/2017,2
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Not fast any more... No updates anymore. DONT BUY! Try ecosia browser.,1,02/08/2018,2

App695,acr.browser.lightning,Nice update!,5,06/11/2017,0
App695,acr.browser.lightning,My favorite browser since I discovered it on vacation back in 2013 in California. You will not find a Faster _  better browser _  I guarantee it and if you do _  tell me! Only have seen it on Android _  may be other places _  wish it was for all platforms. Being on an Android Tablet is even better and more choices.  Our may run slower on a PC or Mac type platform _  which is the only reason I can see why this browser isn't available everywhere _  for if it was and acted the same way as it does on the Android platform _  it would surpass Explorer _  Chrome _  Firefox _  all of them as soon as it gained attention.  Only thing I can't seem to get working and there is a checkbox for it in Settings _  never could get Adobe Flash Player to work with it _  but I see no difference. Love it. Ten Stars.,5,04/14/2017,3
App695,acr.browser.lightning,I like chrome but advertisements makes using Chome unbearable.   Lightening is the best alternative I've found in the app store. It just needs some more features to get five stars _  like syncing bookmarks to my Google Account or better yet a service like pinboard.,4,05/09/2017,18
App695,acr.browser.lightning,ABSOLUTELY BEST MOBILE BROWSER. I've tried what feels like a hundred different mobile browsers. 90% have the Privacy Policy attitude of NSA and the rest is just buggy _  slow and sometimes greedy or just bad. This one is an exception. It is literally the best browser on the Play Store.,5,04/11/2017,2
App695,acr.browser.lightning,As an individual browser it's great _  but I got this to use in conjunction with orbot. At first it worked great with it _  but now it always says 'malformed or illegal search' for every search. It is not much good to me if I can't use it for what I want.,1,01/02/2017,8
App695,acr.browser.lightning,I'm running on Kit Kat and most browsers are pain to use _  they crashing every five minutes but Lightning Browser just keeps on trucking. It works with the dark web better than anything else I've tried on a tablet. Happy to support this work.,5,12/13/2016,11
App695,acr.browser.lightning,After latest update in Nov. 2016 fixing many bugs this browser is as close to perfect as any other mobile browser has come. Only minor  complaint is that it's not clear when I'm in incognito mode. There's no indication I can see.,5,11/30/2016,2
App695,acr.browser.lightning,"Browser opens preset page in tab but when opening link from email it only opens that first tab & you need to hit the link a second time to open it. This not an improvement _  please fix" . . Anthony has fixed this _  well done.,4,11/29/2016,6
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Hello again. Why if I try to do a search from the google page _  the result is a plain text page? And again _  great browser and to me it works without problems (at least so far). But _  one suggestion _  put it the EXIT option in the settings (down in the three dots) _  not every smartphone _  type Galaxy Note series _  has the option to go back or can keep the back button for exit from him. Thank You.,4,11/29/2016,9
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Lightweight and fast. Tugabrowser and others were great but at the cost of crashes and hiccups _  it wasn't worth it. Hope it becomes more refined as time goes on. Keep it up!,5,02/04/2017,0
App695,acr.browser.lightning,There is a bug where the screen brightness is fixed when I open the lightening browser. It doesn't happen to any other app _  and although it is a great browser _  this bug is really bothering me as I went out of my way up purchase the + version...,3,06/01/2017,0
App695,acr.browser.lightning,After last update (v.4.4.2) Lightning just works. Speedy and no page bloat (tabs / bookmarks hidden). Coupled with DuckDuckGo as homepage _  sleek and very customizable. Much effort in the app - and it shows!,5,12/19/2016,3
App695,acr.browser.lightning,It's fast and lightweight _  but the URL selection bug is still present. Until recently when I double clicked the URL it would select it and let me cut _  copy _  paste _  but now it just exits the URL editing. Workaround is to keep your finger down after second tap on the URL _  then you get all the options for cut _  copy... I wish developer resolved this bug _  because I really like this browser.,3,11/29/2016,3
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Browser is great! But I'll give u five stars after adding option not to switch to new page when I choose Open in new window. I just wanna read it later. Thank you!,3,05/29/2017,1
App695,acr.browser.lightning,The only one that works for me! Love that bookmarks and tabs organization! Don't need all those useless features other browsers have. Just made for browsing the web! As simple as that!,5,02/01/2017,1
App695,acr.browser.lightning,It was my go to browser until the latest patch. Something may have bugged and the back (in Android) function will either close the browser _  either go to the home/blank page. That ruined it.,3,02/07/2018,0
App695,acr.browser.lightning,I love it _  its small and fast with minimal bloat _  which works with me _  keep up the good work looking forward to seeing more improvements in updates in the future,5,01/17/2017,0
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Thank you for the update. Favourite browser once again.,5,11/30/2016,2

App695,acr.browser.lightning,The fastest and the lightest,5,11/28/2016,0
App695,acr.browser.lightning,So _  I *really* want to love this app. It has the right balance of features _  simplicity and looks. Ad blocking is great. However _  when the app opens after clicking a link in another app _  Lightning just shows its homepage. You have to go back to Twitter _  or Facebook or whatever app you clicked the link in _  click the link again _  and then Lightning opens up again _  this time showing the correct web page. With this bug fixed (and the ability to have new tabs open in the background) Lightning would be perfect.,3,08/26/2016,16
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Been looking for a decent adblock browser. I think this might be it! Really like the clean interface. Really cool that you can turn off status bar. Took me a few minutes to get used to but then realized quickly that I really like the slide out panels for tabs _  navigation _  and bookmarks. Seems fast and smooth thus far. Settings cover everything needed. One slight complaint is text wrap could be better. See Opera for zoom and text wrap done right. Btw _  someone ripped off ur hard work. See Deebrowser...,4,05/13/2016,11
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Whenever you're on a web page and you tap on the address bar to type in a new URL _  it highlights everything as if it's ready to be replaced with what you're going to type in _  but once you start typing it doesn't overwrite the current URL. This happens way too often since the update,4,07/11/2016,13
App695,acr.browser.lightning,The tab management is atrocious. There's no background tab option _  and whenever you open a new tab _  the list of your open tabs closes and you are sucked into the new tab you just opened. This all needs to be reworked. I need background tabs. And I need to manage my tabs (close AND open) _  without being dragged out of the menu. Also _  inverted rendering still needs a bit of work. Otherwise _  a fast _  clean browser.,3,08/29/2016,2
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Latest updates broke both the paid and free versions. Links no longer open in the background. If you navigate away from the app and come back to the browser all of your web pages that you left open disappears. It's a mess. Hopefully dev will restore previous versions to fix it.,1,05/12/2016,22
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Was a 5 star app but since the latest update when I switch from portrait to landscape back to portrait half the screen is black. The only way to get rid of the black screen is close all tabs. Uninstalling until bug is fixed.,1,06/23/2016,2
App695,acr.browser.lightning,The only other browser that can even remotely compete with Lightning Browser is YuBrowser _  which is heavily optimized for Qualcomm chips. Otherwise _  Lightning Browser is orders of magnitude faster than anything else _  and yet is amongst the most feature-packed browsers out there. Breathes new life into older and newer devices alike.,5,06/14/2016,2
App695,acr.browser.lightning,1. If switching from portrait to landscape and back half of the page becomes blank 2. Search function does not work anymore 3. External links don't open in browser,2,05/06/2016,21
App695,acr.browser.lightning,It worked well before the update. Today the address bar locked up while typing. I had to force close. Also _  it would be great to allow users to use the old behavior when opening new tabs; open in the background.,3,05/12/2016,3
App695,acr.browser.lightning,It has the same issues as what everyone else is having with this update. For anyone trying to fix the bug with links not following through _  enable restore lost tabs on start. Updated 11/15 _  still having basic issue of not opening links properly. Abandoning this software for firefox.,1,11/15/2016,1
App695,acr.browser.lightning,I like the setup _  and the built in ad blocker _  but bugs really hold it back from being the undisputed king. Alot of the time tabs won't display when I look at the tab list _  and sometimes pages just won't load. If these get fixed this would be my browser recommendation for everyone.,4,11/12/2016,0
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Expected features/improvements :  1/ bookmarks: subfolders _  synchronization. Opera speed dial could be a source of UI inspiration although subfolders are not supported 2/ Tab bar: the native vertical tabs organization could allow tree management (e.g. Firefox addon Tree Style Tab). Helpful for those who open a lot of tabs and intend to quickly understand how tabs relate and close/collapse them accordingly. 3/ Contextual websearches within Lightning instead of Google search.,5,04/23/2016,6
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Can you pls improve the ad blocker to completely remove the ads including their borders? Sites like "Cracked" have a visible line where the ads' borders are supposed to be _  wish you can remove it completely. Also pls add the option to open new tabs in the background.,3,05/10/2016,1
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Very impressive browser and I love the ad blocker. At first I thought it wasn't working after I turned it on and then I realized I needed to restart the browser. When I did - ads were blocked. Everything works much faster with the ad blocker on - and even without _  it seems as fast as Chrome on Android.  I give this a 4 star rating because there are some issues:  1. Importing bookmarks from Chrome does not work  at all. I tried this on my Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge phone and my Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 and got the same results.  2. There's a strange thing that happens with the screen when rotating from landscape to portrait orientation. The height of the browser window  doesn't go to the bottom of the screen. Refreshing the page does not solve the problem _  but tapping the control on the phone/tablet to see all open apps - and then going right back into Lightning does solve the problem. Seems like a bit of a bug - which is easy to reproduce every time and on both my android devices.   Other than these issues _  I think it's worth every penny of the $1.50 for the ad blocking version.,4,08/05/2016,1
App695,acr.browser.lightning,For simplicity and ease of use _  this was 1 of 2 go-to browsers _  and 1 of 2 that I gladly gave 5 stars and a few bucks in support of the dev. With the newest version however _  this once fine app now freezes _  lags and stutters and ad-block no longer works. At first I blamed the messed up SM-G900V MM update _  which has more bugs than a Minnesota summer. However _  reading forums and feedback here _  I am now sure the new ver. is to blame. I DO have faith in the dev to fix it _  and I will be back!,3,06/25/2016,2
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Due to "WebView" it's older than Chrome based forks (such as "Free Adblock Browser"). You can't set up the filters you want to use _  or you want to disable _  you can't add custom rules. This is just really annoying.  The rest seems fine _  it's like a browser from Android Froyo or something. Retro feel.,4,10/04/2016,0
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Worked well for me until my N6P updated to Nougat ... Freezes and blank screens now occur.                   But the feature set is excellent. Hope dev updates to overcome these shortcomings,4,09/27/2016,0
App695,acr.browser.lightning,This is the best Android browser I've ever used. It is extremely light and fast (even on my Galaxy smartphone from 2011) _  bookmarks are so easy to reach and it looks really functional and minimal with its great fullscreen mode and black AMOLED theme. My favourite feature is the "Inverted Grayscale" rendering mode- it transforms my AMOLED smartphone to an e-book reader saving battery. Then there is an option to block ads _  set any user agent _  activate text reflow and change the text size of any web page. I really can't believe all these features are able to fit in only 2MB (Chrome was taking more than 100MB on my phone _  bloating more and more and being incredibly slow to start and browse on my Galaxy S II). I'm happy to recommend this browser to anyone.,5,07/29/2016,1
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Used to be the best but now it's too buggy to use as a daily driver and it has been a long time since it has been updated.,3,08/13/2016,1
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Best browser for me _  but since latest update if I rotate the screen to landscape when I go back to portrait the bottom is greyed out. Darn.,4,04/29/2016,1
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Where is the option to open new tabs in the background? How can I copy a link address to the clipboard? I am sure these features disappeared with an update but I need them back.,2,05/09/2016,7
App695,acr.browser.lightning,This one used to be a good one _  but now I suspect if it has backdoor? Tried multiple times _  without it _  OS is stable _  but OS keeps rebooting after using it!,1,08/04/2017,1

App695,acr.browser.lightning,Some minor bugs since last update mainly when switching from portrait to landscape .Overall one of the top of browsers I've ever used on mobile the Ad block feature is the only one I've seen work in a browser will give an additional star for five if the issue with switching rotation is corrected.,5,09/03/2019,0

App695,acr.browser.lightning,It's a good browser. Unfortunately _  the fact that it won't open links from other apps/notifications without having to go back and open it a second time really let's it down for now. Please fix it as soon as you can,3,08/09/2016,0
App695,acr.browser.lightning,It is not responding very often after last update,1,04/24/2016,2
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Fast _  simple _  blocks ads _  has a Night/Dark screen mode _  and my personal favorite _  a Reader mode to remove all the fluff off a webpage. You can also easily import your Chrome bookmarks if you want.,5,08/17/2016,0

App695,acr.browser.lightning,Ad block ticked in the settings but still shows ads... Great :(,1,05/06/2016,1

App695,acr.browser.lightning,I love the super convenient interface (swipe from left to list all opened tabs _  swipe from right to list bookmarks) _  but the newest update made all links that open in a new tab open in the foreground.

App695,acr.browser.lightning,Your a beast Anthony _  amazing you fit the most important features in such a small package. I would have paid for this even if it had no further capabilities. Love the ability to hide the status bar _  invert the colors _  and use an amoled theme. I've recommended this all over so hopefully people will give this fantastic browser a chance! Edit: only thing I would add is split screen support for Samsung,5,03/28/2016,1
App695,acr.browser.lightning,I've tried just about every browser that is worth try. This one has what fits my browsing needs. It hasn't crashed yet. I used the free version for several weeks _  even uninstalled a few times then came back to it. I like it very much and recommend. Mostly I go on Social sites _  browse news _  look up recipes _  things to do _  watch a few videos. This browser workI do use my Android stock browser as a second option. Also have Orbit to complement Lighting for privacy options.,4,10/11/2015,1
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Thought I'd reviewed this when I first installed over a year ago _  apologies. OK _  I avoid using apps when possible _  so all of the usual suspects like FB _  eBay _  Amazon are accessed through a browser and this one by far and away seems the best for how I use my phone. I like that it doesn't need any extra permissions than the ones needed to actually work. Seems to have excellent compatibility _  I can't remember coming across a site that hasn't worked or allowed me to have full functionality. Highly recommended!,5,12/07/2015,3
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Update: 2 years later I come back and it's updated _  it's gotten better. A few things though _  it has an adblock which is nice _  but it also doesn't block every ad. If the app loads a list of servers to which it blocks _  it would be nice if you could add your own to that list. Lastly that some protocols don't work _  ftp being one of them.,3,10/10/2015,9
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Do not be fooled. This is a very useful browser with many features that make browsing with your phone bearable.  Fast _   light yet renders as well as chrome and other heavier apps.  My only gripe is the lack of zoom facility for some websites such as Facebook.  Please add a force zoom facility. But thank you for all the effort that has gone into this.,4,01/10/2016,9
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Won't let me download anything from the web. Gives me an error "Cannot download to specified location". I have the download location set to default /storage/emulated/0/Download. Clearing data and reinstalling doesn't fix it. EDIT: FIXED. For whatever reason _  the app permission was set to not allowing storage access by default. This is a marshmallow issue. Five stars now.,5,11/10/2015,0
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Yeah... I'm greedy. First and foremost _  support this dev. A great job is done on this browser. Light weight _  snappy _  flash and ad block built in. Now for what I want _  force enabled zoom please _  an option to hide nav buttons just like notification bar.,4,11/25/2015,2
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Everything is almost working right. But for some reason I can't seem to download any files because it says my location is wrong. I'm not using a custom location but the default. Any fix to this? I have no idea what the location path is either so I can't set a custom path. Especially because we have to manually type out the path,3,02/25/2016,1
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Really great browser. Like safari for Android with the convenient reader mode. However _  anytime that I try to download an image on my LG G4 with Lightning _  the app crashes and closes. Please fix this and I will gladly change my rating to 5 stars.,3,03/02/2016,0
App695,acr.browser.lightning,When I export bookmarks to backup _  nothing happens. This is happen with Samsung Tab 2 SM-T110.  When I do it on my phone _  it actually shows it saving and to where. Please help fix this. I am really liking this browser thank you.,5,01/30/2016,1

App695,acr.browser.lightning,Please add a system to save passwords and bookmarks _  so that when I reinstall the app I can get my saved stuff back with login credentials.,5,02/15/2016,0
App695,acr.browser.lightning,I bought this app for $1.50 hoping that ut would let me view sites that needs a flash player _  but I was disappointed that I can't enable the setting for flash player. Please tell me if there is a way that I can enable this.,1,10/20/2015,1
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Was a fantastic app but the latest updated version exits without errors whenever a page is loaded.  I had to revert to a previously backed up version. *UPDATE*  Because of the author's failure to fix ANY of these bugs I have decided to go back to using Firefox.  At least it works on my device.  Developer has ignored muliple emails asking for support. App no longer usable.,1,06/02/2016,0
App695,acr.browser.lightning,1GB of RAM (~650 MB of that is usable) has showed me a pretty big issue with this browser -- eventually _  other apps will start closing and sooner or later Lightning itself will OOM. So running it on powerful phones is the only way to go but that defeats its purpose because those phones can also run browsers with far more functionality.,3,10/08/2015,13
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Every time I try to download a file _  lighting tells me I can't download to specified region _  or straight up crashes. Lighting is great _  better then chrome _  but this has been  plaguing my devices (Nexus 6p _  Android 6.0 _  galaxy s6 edge _  5.0.2). Please fix,2,11/13/2015,1
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Very fast _  minimal _  adblocking and tor support baked in _  love it.  It does crash now and then _  but all in all excellent app.  I would love to see a new icon _  and the ability to add a bookmark as a shortcut onto the phones home page.,5,03/22/2016,2
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Tapping the URL field highlights all current text _  indicating it is selected _  but when you start typing instead of replacing what was there with what you're typing it simply adds what you're typing where you tapped. Also even with ad blocker turned off it doesn't allow Google ads click throughs and I don't think it can save passwords either which is annoying. Flip side? It's fast and lightweight. Just not the current browser for me,2,10/06/2016,0
App695,acr.browser.lightning,App started out great _  5-stars _  no complaints. Recently though _  it won't allow me to download pics/gifs from the browser. The program stops _  automated "this sh** isn't working rn" message pops up. Please fix. Very annoying.,3,02/04/2016,0
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Found it difficult to clear all tabs when not in tab view with the tabs up top. Also buggy time to time and would freeze when opened. Does not load some webpages properly and whenever I try to open an url by google ad services it just directs me to a blank page that is not the url that was displayed. I really want to make this my main browser but sadly I can't because of these drawbacks :(,3,05/02/2016,0
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Has adblock _  a good design _  and themes. Only problems I have is that the import bookmarks doesn't seem to work with Chrome and no Chromecast support.,5,03/28/2016,0
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Latest update has caused numerous problems.  This was a great browser please return it to its glory!,1,07/27/2016,3
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Love this browser. Also plays nice with auto backup in Android _  so moving to a new phone is a delight. Bookmarks and settings from before just show up automatically! 👍,5,11/05/2015,0
App695,acr.browser.lightning,I love this app to bits but I have one issue where longer webpages will stop loading and just show a blank white page.,3,11/23/2015,0
App695,acr.browser.lightning,I want to love it but I can't download anything. The browser keeps crashing. I'm on Marshmallow if that makes a difference.,3,11/05/2015,0
App695,acr.browser.lightning,What's with every so often the play store launches straight to "words with friends". I bought the app because I didn't want ads. Is this a bug?,4,10/16/2015,1
App695,acr.browser.lightning,How a material browser ought to be. I would love to see a feature to add a Mozilla account in the near future and perhaps a quick "Desktop view" button in the dropdown menu.,5,10/24/2015,1
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Is there a material design update in the works by any chance? The app looks pretty good but I think it could use a little UI tweaking,4,02/09/2016,0
App695,acr.browser.lightning,I love this browse everything fine with me  but I can't chatting cuz this browse not support java!!  I tried chrome browse they support chrome for Java so please add java :/,4,01/25/2016,1
App695,acr.browser.lightning,This is just a niche request to an otherwise brilliant browser _  but do you think it would be possible to add a force zoom function and quick disable Javascript from the browser menu rather than the settings. Great work!,5,01/04/2016,0
App695,acr.browser.lightning,This is an excellent lightweight browser that takes up a fraction of the storage hogged by Chrome _  Firefox _  and others. It has essential features for me like adblock and inverted mode _  and best of all...it's open source!,5,12/20/2015,0
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Finally _  a browser that has a true AMOLED mode. I love the inverted grayscale rendering mode _  that allows for viewing all pages in black. This is just what I was looking for.  Great job _  dev.,5,02/12/2016,1
App695,acr.browser.lightning,But Link Bubble can't recognize it as a browser? Also the separation between incognito and normal tabs is weird. I can't access my normal tabs when I have incognito tabs open,4,01/09/2016,0
App695,acr.browser.lightning,used free one for a long time. loving it _  bought it to support developer - F-Droid User,5,12/20/2015,0
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Bought the paid version for the ad blocking feature. It doesn't work and for some reason I cannot get a refund.,3,11/09/2015,0
App695,acr.browser.lightning,The best and Light-weight browser on Android. I hope there are more features like Bookmarks Sync with Google and better zooming capability. Love it ♥.,4,02/05/2016,1
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Ended up here while searching for the fastest browser. No doubt that it's light as hell when compared to chrome dev. All this while being ad free.,5,01/23/2016,1
App695,acr.browser.lightning,But it crashes with maddening and frustrating regularity. Dev is unresponsive.,2,12/26/2015,1

App695,acr.browser.lightning,Waste of money _  useless.  Geolocation does not work _  flash is greyed out anyway _  what's the point of even using this?,1,03/07/2016,0
App695,acr.browser.lightning,For me this is the best browser hands down! It is faster then any other browser out there including chrome and firefox. Lots of customization options...Keep up the great work!,5,04/11/2016,0
App695,acr.browser.lightning,This browser is simple _  fast and extremely stable. It does need better cache clearing but that aside this is a very nice little browser.,4,10/04/2015,2
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Please make use of immersive mode in your app (when full screen mode is checked). So there won't be a giant navigation bar at the bottom when browsing.,4,10/24/2015,0
App695,acr.browser.lightning,No gasta tantos recursos como Chrome o Firefox _  tiene bloqueador de anuncios integrado y es muy manejable. Cuando guarde las contraseñas correctamente tendrá 5 estrellas.,4,11/13/2015,0

App695,acr.browser.lightning,the latest update broke lightning _  it became unusable,1,05/26/2016,1
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Very very fast but not as smooth as chrome. Can I receive notifications? Why some other browsers like dolphin supports flash but lighting doesn't?,4,01/04/2016,0
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Great browser _  I'm happy to support it with the paid version _  only problem is the ad blocking doesn't seem to work for me,4,02/12/2016,0
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Minimal and fast _  and I bought the paid version to block ads,5,11/14/2015,1
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Please add more text sizes and ability to provide alternative ad blocking rules like ruadlist.,5,03/29/2016,0
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Sliding the tab browser and bookmarks list from the edges of the screen feels great. Adblock is another definite plus. Purchased to support the dev.,5,10/12/2015,0

App695,acr.browser.lightning,Lightning is awesome. It is lightweight _  fast _  efficient modern design _  auto colors website's headers _  and doesn't use much battery.,5,01/10/2016,0
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Clean ui _ nice interface with adblock options.Ad blocking can be improved with different filter lists..,4,04/10/2016,0
App695,acr.browser.lightning,I love this browser and I'd definitely give it 5 stars if there was the ability to print webpages.,4,02/22/2016,0
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Worth the money for sure. The adblocker works like a charm and to my GS4 its faster than chrome,5,11/27/2015,0

App695,acr.browser.lightning,The App evolved beautifully,5,02/10/2016,0
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Great,5,01/01/2016,0
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Some websites _  mine included _  displays a gray background instead of white. I didn't set a bg color on my body and every other browser displays white but this one prefers the gray side. Sometimes major sites like Google and others will show as having a gray bg color as well. Please fix. Free version doesnt have this issue. Also _  instead of 5 different font sizes _  make an option to enter exact percentage because 3rd option is too small and 4th is a bit too big. 120% is ideal imho.,4,08/22/2015,1
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Fast _  works great _  love it. But...when I open it _  despite choosing Blank Page as the new tab option _  it shows Google. That's not blank. I was hoping that Blank Page would mean a black screen (with the theme set to black). At least make a dark version of the Google start page if I can't actually get a real blank page. Also _  Color Mode doesn't work for me.,4,09/23/2015,0
App695,acr.browser.lightning,I'm very glad to have found this broswer. I was frustrated to find the lg g4 came with chrome(which I'm not a fan of on mobile) in place of the reliable stock browser. I was looking for a broswer that delivered an experience close to the stock browser _  and this delivers. Smooth scrolling _  bookmarks easily accessible on the side _  full screen mode _  and great ad blocking make for the best web experience I have found. I would definitely recommend this broswer. Kudos to the developers!,5,09/10/2015,0
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Tried all the browsers and went back and forth many times. When I first tried Lightning some time ago it was still very crude but it's come a long way. Plus version is worth the expense to me to always have the latest and of course ad blocking. Pull down to refresh would be nice to have and a confirmation popup when a bookmark is added.,5,08/23/2015,1
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Great for devices with very little RAM. Crashes regularly. I would love for the app to go back to the homepage after the last tab is closed instead of the entire app quitting. Can't save HTML5 video/audio. Can't open URLs in another app like with Firefox. Would like a more extensive history page. Downloaded apk files don't open with the installer by default somehow _  when downloaded with other apps the apk files open fine.,3,09/15/2015,0
App695,acr.browser.lightning,I really want to give this app a higher rating _  but the regular crashes are getting out of hand. It seems to crash after heavy-ish browser use _  if the browser was left open for a while _  or after certain pages are opened up. It's still my daily driver because the speed and adblock are great _  but I don't know if it'll be like that for much longer if the crashing persists. It's not uncommon for it to crash at least twice a day. LG G3 Lollipop,3,09/24/2015,2
App695,acr.browser.lightning,To the developer who made this browser _  thank you so much _  it's all I could ever ask for. Fast _  simple _  clean _  and the ad block is awesome _  no more accidentally tapping them. I only have one problem. When I watch a video in full screen mode I can't control anything like pause _  play _  volume _  etc. I saw that the most recent update was supposed to fix the issue _  but the problem still persists for me.,4,09/21/2015,0
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Needs a few additions to make it as good as the top browsers: 1) In the searchbox _  put a button to clear everything inside it at once _  I hate having to manually delete long URLs. 2) Modify the text when you swipe right in incognito mode to say "Incognito Tabs" instead of just "Tabs". It's confusing to tell if I'm on incognito or not as both the dark theme and incognito have the same color scheme. 3) Put a lock in the search box when you're on a HTTPS site _  or a lack thereof when you're not. Good job!,4,08/29/2015,2
App695,acr.browser.lightning,So far I am in love with this browser. It's quick _  it's responsive _  it's elegant and simple in its design. Maybe the best implementation of tabbed browsing on mobile _  brought out in a list from a side panel making moving between then so smooth. Adblock and reader mode are also built in which makes reading articles and browsing the web a breeze~,4,09/04/2015,0
App695,acr.browser.lightning,When I try and download pictures from websites or google images _  they download in the wrong file type like html or something. They never download in jpg png gif etc.,3,08/24/2015,0
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Really fast _  and doesn't eat battery like Chrome. This has become my default browser.  Only small request would be that 'color mode' uses the meta theme-color value if available _  and the current system if it's not.,5,09/29/2015,0
App695,acr.browser.lightning,It doesnt have a option to download videos _  I've seen it for photos though. Also missing a home button. Once those get added _  then hell yeah this would be 5 stars from me.,4,09/03/2015,0
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Diss not block ads. Ugh. Please refund my money,1,09/16/2015,0
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Please add ability to cache bookmark fav icons. It reloads the bookmark icons every time I open the bookmark drawer.,4,04/01/2017,2

App695,acr.browser.lightning,This is my favorite browser on Android. Great work!!! I've seen a lot of apps get ruined because the developers don't know when to stop adding feature after feature. This app is light _  fast _ has ad blocking and a sensible well thought out UI. PLEASE DONT RUIN IT BY TRYING TO ADD EVERY FEATURE UNDER THE SUN.,5,08/01/2015,2
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Been using Chrome for a while and nothing really compared to it. Except this browser. It's faster _  lighter and blocks ads and most importantly has some material design. Well done developer!,5,08/02/2015,0
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Thanx for taking the time to develop this wonderful app. It's by far the best browser for Android!                                   BadBrainsEddie,5,08/04/2015,0

App695,acr.browser.lightning,Love it,5,07/31/2015,0
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Fantastic collection of features that is updated regularly. Has one of the better implementations of reverse rendering _  but it would be nice if this feature could be toggled without having too access a preference sub-menu...Maybe in a future update perhaps? (Hint _  hint :D ).            More than worth the minor cost and the only Android browser you need.  I have not been experiencing random crashes as other reviewers have complained about.  Fast and stable on my M8 with CM12 based PacRom LP-5.1!,5,06/14/2015,2
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Good browser. It's quite reliable and fast. The big problem is with the address/search bar in full screen mode. It doesn't move fluidly (like it used to) and always blocks any search bar that your typing in. It's really annoying.,3,05/27/2015,9
App695,acr.browser.lightning,The speed and memory efficiency of this browser puts Chrome and Firefox to shame. It makes my Moto X and Nexus 7 far more usable. A million thanks to the dev for building it!,5,05/07/2015,6
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Lightweight and fast _  opens and closes instantaneously and switches between tabs with ease _  even despite the poor memory management of Lollipop. Adblock is definitely worth the asking price for the paid version.,5,05/06/2015,3
App695,acr.browser.lightning,I'll need a few days of usage to make an informed judgment. It has a stripped down look _  but there are more than enough customizations to satisfy me. Anything is better than Chrome in that respect. UPDATE: Emailed developer regarding lack of home screen shortcut option (no response). Still using Dolphin for shortcuts. No crashes on Galaxy Note 4. Adblock works perfectly!,4,05/15/2015,2
App695,acr.browser.lightning,1 Suggestion: Allow shortcuts to be added to the address bar.  Things like reader mode _  home _  back and forward.,5,05/30/2015,0
App695,acr.browser.lightning,I like the lightweight browser and design _  but I find that it will close tabs when switching between applications where other browsers wouldn't.  Using s6 edge,3,07/07/2015,2
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Please add multi window features for galaxy note's user!  It will be amazing update..please add multi window features I don't want to use chrome again,5,05/28/2015,2
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Love it _  however _  sometimes the scroll physics switch off _  meaning my scrolling action loses momentum. Please fix. Otherwise this is perfect. Thanks for offering features without sacrificing privacy.,5,06/16/2015,0
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Never paid for a browser _  tried free version it's super fast _  however ad block does not block everything. Some sites got smarter with ads. Maybe you guys could add ghostery as well?,5,06/09/2015,0
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Super fast and not a memory hog like other popular browsers. Worth every penny.,5,05/23/2015,2
App695,acr.browser.lightning,I have to say _   I've just been using this for a day and it's the fastest browser I've seen. Very good.,5,05/09/2015,1

App695,acr.browser.lightning,Much faster than chrome on my 2015 moto e,5,07/03/2015,0
App695,acr.browser.lightning,The new look and new(thankfully few) features are great. Just one thing _  holding the back button used to close the app and all tabs and now it pulls up a menu to close. If I wanted to close just a single tab I would swipe right and close it. I hold the back button intentionally to close the app. Just seems a little redundant to have that dialog pop up.,4,04/29/2015,1
App695,acr.browser.lightning,I was shocked by how this newest update improved lightning! The new full screen transition is much less disturbing _  and this UI is as beautiful and intuitive as what chrome should have been. Money well well spent.,5,05/02/2015,3
App695,acr.browser.lightning,While I do miss being able to sync my Chrome bookmarks _  this browser is insanely fast and lightweight. I don't think I'll be going back to Chrome anytime soon!,5,04/28/2015,3
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Revelation chapter 14 _  verse 4,5,05/03/2015,1
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Best browser by far _  feature rich _  slick _  stable _  built in ad blocker _  highly configurable _  I love it. Just one feature more would make it perfect... a proper Night Mode (black/deep grey background _  white/off white type and images as normal) That would be the cherry on top. Really like the new update though _  thanks.,5,04/25/2015,4
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Feature rich _  crazy fast but still very lightweight and battery friendly. Adblock function is the best ever on a mobile browser. No problems on Nexus 5. Highly recommend (do get the paid version for adblock),5,04/25/2015,2
App695,acr.browser.lightning,The best just got even better with this new material design update! Nice to see the developer continue support for this amazing browser. It's light _  fast _  and always gets the job done wonderfully. Keep up the great support!,5,04/25/2015,1
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Popup ads come through even when ad blocking is turned on. Some links on Facebook won't render,4,05/04/2015,1
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Thank you dev.  Love the ui.  Love the smoothness.  By the way _   thanks for the improved ads block and black theme.  Gonna love it compare to the other browser.,5,04/25/2015,3
App695,acr.browser.lightning,I wish the tab numbers could be brought back. I think it's useful to know how many tabs are open. Pleeaaaase bring them back,5,04/27/2015,1
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Love it. Just needs better bookmark management!,5,04/26/2015,0
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Adblocking without root!  For those asking for an exit button _  it appears that the developer has saved on "screen clutter".  To exit _  LONG-PRESS the "back" button on your device.  This backs you out to your start page _  closes all tabs _  and closes Lightning.,4,11/14/2014,3
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Need to test more _  but I like this browser!  Really disappointed that you can't use flash in KitKat and above _  even if you sideload it.  Yes _  flash is not supported and is not perfect _  but there are still A LOT of sites that require it.  Dev should please reconsider _  even if they add a pop-up warning when you turn it on in options.,3,01/30/2015,0
App695,acr.browser.lightning,5 stars if full screen is modified to be less jarring when the omni bar appears/disappears and if search suggestions gain an arrow that adds the suggested text to the omni bar. I'd find a way to give it 6 stars if Chromecast support was added.,4,11/11/2014,0
App695,acr.browser.lightning,See my review on the free version. Buy this app - it's definitely worth every penny! This browser _   with find in page _   easy bookmarks and back/forward pages _  far surpasses Chrome _   IE _  Firefox _  Maxthon and all other browsers. Simply put _   there is no other option.. This IS the browser to get and to buy!,5,12/02/2014,3
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Dropped this Chrome for this browser. Blazingly fast _  and the Dev is doing this as merely a side project. Props to him! Easily worth more than $1.50.,5,01/09/2015,1
App695,acr.browser.lightning,For some reason it makes gapps to crash sometimes _  mostly when I'm in Facebook (I rather to use Facebook in web _  its app sucks hard). Also _  I can't save images of some sites where I'm usually able to save them with other browsers. Fix that _  please.,3,04/24/2015,1
App695,acr.browser.lightning,For example _  open incognito tab and goto some shopping site. Add item to cart. Close tab and close browser. Try above again and notice the item is still in cart.,2,11/15/2014,11
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Pretty good browser that's easy to use _  too bad it crashes every few minutes and when you have 8+ tabs open _  it becomes so responsive you'll have to keep tapping links for a minute before it registers. Highly NOT recommended!,1,12/28/2014,2
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Please make an exit button! Thanks in advance if that can happen.  😉,5,10/24/2014,0
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Very low ram usage _  built in ad blocker _  a truly dark theme _  and incognito mode are some of the features of this brilliant browser by an XDA developer.,5,11/16/2014,1

App695,acr.browser.lightning,At the moment It works like a charm!,5,02/05/2015,0
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Within a minute of trying the free version I purchased the full version. It does everything I need it to do and does it more quickly or better than most of the alternatives. I have tried many mobile browsers and this is the best of its kind for me.The only thing that I was a bit shocked to see was that text reflow for this app is not supported on Android Kitkat 4.4. Opera browser supports this feature on Kitkat. Just wondering if there are any plans to develop a text reflow feature for devices running Kitkat? Thank you.,5,07/27/2014,8
App695,acr.browser.lightning,The irony of the Android ecosystem is that to date Chrome STILL answers search queries with a blank page on a regular basis. After months of trying/abandoning other browsers this one showed up and it's brilliant. Barebones doesn't begin to describe it but it works. It is fast as Chrome ever is and easy on the eye to boot. Few options means less tampering and of course _  no ads touting their other products. It works fast and well and so far zero crashes. I'll happily pay for a night setting too,5,07/28/2014,4
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Am using the paid app. This browser can't hold on for more than ten minutes before crashing. Developer needs to do something if (s)he cares.,1,09/04/2014,0
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Needs home button as already noted. Could do with a little "progress bar" or "working" gif to confirm search status. Needs a working clear cookies on exit option. "Lightning" is a bit of an exaggeration- it's only as fast as the slowest link in the chain and the old and much loved Opera browser is faster (IMO) Messes with "Hacker's Keyboard". (carriage return absent) Could be better then _  but I'm confident it will be in time.,3,08/22/2014,2
App695,acr.browser.lightning,A quick and easy-to-use browser. With its' simple design packed with the necessary features; this can give you the most pleasant browsing experience. Leaving out one star just to give room for more improvement.,4,04/30/2014,1
App695,acr.browser.lightning,This Browser is great but one thing I require to call it euphemistically perfect is bookmark syncing with Chrome. I have a memory loss disability and I use a computer _  a tablet and my phone. With everything in sync _  life is fast _  functional and things get done as they should. The diametric opposite that happens when things are not in sync is depressing and that's only the first word of many for a description. Oh Lightning... So close.,4,06/30/2014,0
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Is the only issue I have so far.  I like it _   but it gets annoying.  Need consistency.  I was forced to go back to chrome. But I prefer this app.,3,10/13/2014,0
App695,acr.browser.lightning,A browser that runs well on older _  slower devices and has built in Adblock? Yes _  please! Well worth the paltry sum being charged for it.,5,08/27/2014,2
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Loved the free version SO much _  bought the pro.  This browser is fast _  smooth and stable.  Have tried them all.  This has become my go to browser!,5,05/04/2014,1
App695,acr.browser.lightning,This browser can do everything you need: browse the web. The UI is just native Android: I like it simple. Also this is the only browser that's 100% responsive on my old Galaxy S (Android 4.4.4).,5,07/08/2014,0

App695,acr.browser.lightning,Very smooth,4,05/10/2014,0
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Aside from the clean look _  I purchased this app because I really admire the way it handles tabs (sliding in from the left) and bookmarks (sliding in from the right).  The more I use it _  the more I'm coming to appreciate the simplicity and consistency of its design. Plus _  it's one of the few browsers that looks good on my tablet. UPDATE:  The addition of ad blocking removed the last hurdle to making this my default browser.,5,04/26/2014,2

App695,acr.browser.lightning,Fixed Nexus 7 and Nexus 10 tablet bug with this update. The names says it all. Fastest browser for Android. It'll be cool if you can add a "Reader Mode" feature to make reading articles easier.,5,01/20/2014,3

App695,acr.browser.lightning,It is very smooth (like Safari on Apple devices) and can beat out any other browser. It is clean and bug free. Honestly _  I had no problem paying for the paid version and I'm that guy that normally just uses the free stuff.,5,08/24/2013,1
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Paid version needs to look better and have more features than the free version _  like a better looking icon that's a totally different design _  it also needs more features like other browsers and that the free version doesn't have _  like sliding and just an updated look _  also be a bit faster and smaller in size _  also have different themes and designs to make it look better and more customizable with a updated and better interface.,3,09/08/2013,1
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Works great for most sites. However it needs an option to dispay websites in desktop mode. I hate mobile websites. Will give it 5 stars when thats added.,4,08/09/2013,1

App695,acr.browser.lightning,Shows a true desktop experience w/flash if that's your preference. If you close the browser and come back to it through multi tasking _  only one tab will come back up... even if you had multiple ones showing when you closed. I really like this browser; hope everything gets fixed. Super fast and low profile.  8/7/2013 - Forced close when trying to access advanced settings.,3,08/07/2013,1
App695,acr.browser.lightning,When watching a YouTube video it doesn't go into full screen mode and there are white borders around the edges and makes the video look tiny.

App695,acr.browser.lightning,Works great.,5,08/03/2013,0
App695,acr.browser.lightning,I decided to purchase the full version just so you were more likely to read my review haha _  app is super fast and looks fantastic. got some suggestions for you _  when watching a video on youtube for example (even though most people use the app) when you rotate your screen to landscape the navigation bar blocks a large portion of the video _  so somehow detect a video playing and make it full screen? also with the nav bar having the tabs aswell makes it very bulky and takes up a lot of viewing area. And also my last suggestion _  when retyping a URL that youve previously searched _  with the suggestions popping up make them just 1 long text box instead of a huge cube. these isues arent really that big _  just thought id give my 2 cents to help improve the app so you can 1 day be at the top of the play store!,4,05/20/2013,3
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Had free version always force close so bought paid always force close since recent update REPAIR...........................................It was great but let's fix it.............As of April 15th still crashes.Can we really fix this time please.................................................................... Period,2,04/14/2013,1
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Very fast when loading pages and very decent scrolling performance (I'm very demanding when it comes to scrolling). Page rendering seems to be flawless as far as I've seen. Unfortunately _  there are still (minor but still too many) flaws that are holding it back: -Bookmarks are too simplistic _  presentation is lacking and there is no way to rearrange them -Annoying bug when setting about:home as starting page to have the bookmark page open _  as soon as a tab is closed _  it won't work anymore and will default to about:blank -Pressing the X to close a tab seems a bit difficult _  maybe the hotspot is too small...? -No home button!? -When opening a new tab and it displays about:home _  it is necessary to wipe it by hand before typing an address or a search -Fullscreen mode is far from perfect and too rudimentary _  having it appear over the page as soon as placed at the top is annoying _  it should ideally appear when scrolling and stay for a second and then go away (like most other fullscreen browsers) Apart from that _  it's still my main browser on my Nexus 4 with CM10.1 _  but for a paid product _  it needs to be perfect. Correct those flaws and it's a solid 5 stars for me.,3,04/01/2013,2

App695,acr.browser.lightning,I use this on ASUS TF700t.  I needed to have access to a specific site that requires flash.  I was fine until I made the mistake of upgrading to JB.  I went through all kinds of hoops trying to get flash to work.  I managed to get it working for lots of sites but never for the one place I really needed it to work.  I was pretty much thinking I was going to have risk unlocking & rooting my device to get back to ICS.  I thought I would try 1 more browser claiming to support flash.  It works flawlessly.  No problems so far.  I haven't noticed any big improvement in speed _  but it is definitely  not any slower than any others.  Great App _  keep up the good work.,5,02/18/2013,3
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Used to be fast with ad block and all. Now lags _  freezes and at times only renders half of the page. Waited for two months without seeing a fix. I'm out for now. Hope things will change down the road.,2,07/09/2016,1

App695,acr.browser.lightning,I've tried nearly all the browsers available for Android and never been completely happy with any of them. Then I stumbled acorss Lightning in Tablified Market _   and man _   so pleased I did. Yes _   at this stage its a bit more basic than others _   but its truly fast _  nice Ui _  very small size (200kb) and supports Flash superbly! And the developer responds to emails and fixes problems super quick. Still needs some improvements _  like being able to edit the names of bookmarks _   but overall it really is the best browser available for Android. Give it a try _   doubt you will be disappointed.,5,03/12/2013,3
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Hate the time it takes to load the pages Firefox loads in a blink of an eyes. Need a refund Mr. Developer. You shouldn't be selling it with false claims.,1,08/16/2014,0
App695,acr.browser.lightning,Lightning Browser+ is an awesome browser; simplistic _  yet powerful enough for moderate power-users. However _  there are some bugs...if you have the left drawer (tab-drawer) open while entering an address the browser crashes when you press enter _  it never fails. Also _  when you press the "x" to close a tab at the bottom of the list _  it sometimes closes a random tab near the top of the list. (Running on Android 4.4.4 _  Nexus 5),4,09/16/2014,0
