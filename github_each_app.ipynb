            "2) Simple and quick to use. Stored all my cards in 10 mins. (0.89)\n",

            "4) Good job! Just a tiny detail _  card note font size doesn't seem to work and note looks half-hidden until you tap it _  but it's irrelevant. Great app! (0.88)\n",
            "5) Card information is easy to enter. The user interface is simple _  efficient and to the point. I like that the app uses minimal permissions (no network access needed) and doesn't bombard me with advertisements. (0.88)\n",
            "6) I haven't had to carry a wallet since installing this excelent App _  brilliant. Clean simple interface _  tiny memory footprint (between only 12 & 30% that of the higher rated competition!) _  & free! Would have given 5 stars if it would facilitate customisation of list order (displays cards in alphabetical order only). I will contact the dev with this suggestion _  & happily upgrade rating to 5 stars should they impliment it. (0.87)\n",
            "7) Excellente application! L√©g√®re _  sauvegarde facile _  partage possible _  tr√®s rapide _  n'utilise pas les donn√©es. I miss possibility to add an image or a complete photo of the real card _  but thank you anyway! (0.87)\n",
            "8) Simple and straightforward local storage _  no unnecessary cloud account _  no junk or ads and totally free. Five stars! Would appreciate the possibility to add a little (company) image/logo/icon to each card that would be visible in the card listing _  for a more fancy look of the cards (0.86)\n",
            "9) Widget text color is wrong _  nice simple app otherwise but the widget doesn't stick to the standard android font of white text with a black outline _  the text is all black so barely readable to be able to tell which card is which (0.86)\n",
